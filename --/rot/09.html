<p>Madeleine stared directly at me. She said, &quot;Just stop<span class="mdash"></span>everything. Your own suffering will end. And it will be better for the world. This is true for all of us. It is true for me. It is true for you. We just aren't necessary.&quot;</p>

<p>She turned and walked back through the vines and branches. Nearly invisible in the gloom, all but hidden behind a wall of overgrowth, a door opened in the side of a building, a momentary sliver of black shadow. It closed and Madeleine was gone.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>The smell of excrement<span class="mdash"></span>of people<span class="mdash"></span>became overwhelming. They emerged from the shadows between the trees as furtively as if they were shadows themselves. They stepped forward. One of them, standing directly before me, was tall, nearly as tall as Puckwood, and as thick around his chest and middle as a bear. He reached a paw into a pocket of his jacket and extracted an item that gleamed in an unnatural manner like nothing else in that place<span class="mdash"></span>a knife.</p>

<p>I had not realized until that moment how quiet everything had become<span class="mdash"></span>even the thunder of the helicopters had descended into a low-pitched hum, a drone from somewhere far off, a sound like something out of a dream and not something that had anything to do with me<span class="mdash"></span>until a sharp crack split the air. The tall man's forehead exploded in a mass of blood spurts and bone fragments and his body collapsed as swiftly as a sack filled with rocks. More shots thundered out. The people ran, vanishing back into the trees like a heap of dried leaves hurled about by a sudden gust of wind. Doors opened and slammed shut as bullets crackled off bricks and concrete.</p>

<p>The shots ended. Silence ensued for a full minute or more. Someone approached me from behind while whipping up a storm of noise<span class="mdash"></span>shattering tree limbs, kicking and hacking bushes away, splashing into puddles. It might have been a man unfamiliar and thoroughly impatient with this territory or it might have been an elephant. Finally a gray sack pressed itself close to my own. Below the hood was the black jacket and black pants of a policeman.</p>

<p>&quot;I know you,&quot; he said. &quot;Frust. Inspector Frust or Detective Frust or some other title that you didn't earn. One of those scum who work for the feds. What did you do before this? Did you sell insurance? Did you clean toilets? Did you have one of those lady jobs where you sat a desk and went clickety-clack on a computer all day? What was it, Frust? Did you secretly dream of a being a real man, a cop?&quot;</p>

<p>He stuck a cigarette into the mouth hole of his sack and lit and let the smoke fall out of his mouth in a cloud into my face.</p>

<p>&quot;Today is your lucky day. Sort of. Not really. You're still going to die<span class="mdash"></span>only it's going to be a fuckload more painful than this fucking gorilla&quot;<span class="mdash"></span>he stepped on the head of the tall dead man, grinding his boot into the muck that was left of the man's skull<span class="mdash"></span>&quot;was gonna do it.&quot;</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>The din of the helicopters reverberated in a thunderous detonation of sound. There were at least three helicopters<span class="mdash"></span>and perhaps as many as half a dozen. The noise obliterated all other sounds before they reached my ears. It shook the ground and the trees. Leaves and twigs, loosened as if in a gale, flicked off the sack on my head and off my arms and legs. I suppose, in hindsight, that upon experiencing that noise, I should have expected what was about to happen.</p>

<p>The man before me sighed with a stupendous burst of toxic breath; beneath the sack his head might have actually been nothing more than a dead animal, a skunk or a raccoon, that had been crushed under a truck's wheels and then lain on the asphalt for days under the hot sun as it became bloated with noxious gases that had only now, at this moment, escaped through some sudden tear in the carcass's hide. His eyes, glimpsed through the holes cut into the sack, expressed a mixture of resignation and anger. The next moment his head<span class="mdash"></span>sack and all<span class="mdash"></span>simply vanished.</p>

<p>His body<span class="mdash"></span>just like that of the previous man who had been about to kill me<span class="mdash"></span>dropped like a bag filled with rocks. With the din from the helicopters, I had never heard the shot. I am certain the dead man never heard it either.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>The ropes which bound me into the trees were hacked apart. My body tumbled through vines and branches and landed with a dull thud in the mud. My mind was merely a passenger at that point. I was more upside down than right-side up and when I fell my arms took the brunt of the fall, the weight of my body plowing into my shoulders and elbows. I was certain that I had broken something, or at the very least dislocated a shoulder. I wasn't nearly as young and spritely as I used to be.</p>

<p>The mud I had fallen into was in one of the troughs between the mounds. The bottom was half puddle, half slime, and I was caked in it. But at least it dampened the fall. It would've been worse if I had landed on something hard, on concrete or a tree stump.</p>

<p>The barrel of an assault rifle was prodded into the mud beside me and then into my ribs as if the soldier wielding it were checking if I were still alive. When I shuddered he shoved it, mud and all, into my nose. The metal was cold and, because of the mud, it stunk of excrement<span class="mdash"></span>I supposed what they used for manure to bring this backyard wilderness to fruition was their own waste. But I was not afraid of being shot<span class="mdash"></span>or perhaps not as afraid as I should've been. The soldier would've been strung up by his balls if he'd killed me. I glanced up past the soldier's shoulder. The whole area was flooded with light now from the choppers that hovered directly above us, although that meant that everything on the ground was either stark white or impenetrable black.</p>

<p>The soldier rammed the muzzle of the gun harder into my nose. He stomped my ribs with his boots. The cloth of his sack, about where his mouth would have been, pulsated and jumped as he screamed at me. Because of the helicopters, I couldn't hear a thing. His next kick was straight into my belly; all the air in my body shot out of me like a rocket. The only thing that would've been more painful would've been getting stomped in the nuts.</p>

<p>The helicopters lifted away. Their din lessened. I could heard the soldier: &quot;Get the fuck up!&quot;</p>

<p>I put my hands flat into the mud and set weight upon my arms. They were not broken after all. I pushed myself up to my knees. I stood. I was drenched. Mud as heavy as wet concrete slid down the front of my suit. The soldier aimed his gun back into my face. Sergeant's stripes were stitched onto his sleeve. Another soldier<span class="mdash"></span>a private<span class="mdash"></span>stepped forward and spread the lapels of my jacket apart. He dipped his hand into the empty holster.</p>

<p>&quot;No gun!&quot; he shouted.</p>

<p>From the inside pocket of the jacket he lifted my badge. He flipped it open and held it up into the light.</p>

<p>&quot;It's Klust,&quot; he yelled.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>A helicopter descended, closer and with more noise than any of them had descended yet, and the silhouettes of soldiers spilled out of it and onto the roof of one of the buildings. When a dozen or so soldiers has disembarked, the helicopter ascended rapidly and sped away into the night. Perhaps another half dozen soldiers patrolled the mud of this urban forest. I waited for another chopper to take the place of the first but none did. It was the army<span class="mdash"></span>I would've expected a company of men, at least, a hundred men or more, but this was it. Perhaps they were all that was needed for this operation, or perhaps even the army was falling apart. I did not share my observation with the young soldier who still stood before me. The last helicopter was now no more than a distant rumble and a few flickering lights high above us. The forest was washed in darkness.</p>

<p>Gunshots echoed from the streets beyond the buildings. The individual pops of standard-issue police sidearms were followed by the heavier rat-tat-tak of the army's assault rifles. A full-on gun battle was raging. The racket of a dozen or more separate guns filled the night<span class="mdash"></span>or at least that is how many there were at the beginning of the battle.</p>

<p>My eyes began to adjust to the gloom. The head sacks of the soldiers nearby were tilted upwards; they must've been trying to ascertain the progress of the battle, as I was. They stood apart, none of them speaking. I had the impression that if I had interrupted the silence, I would've received another kick in the guts.</p>

<p>The battle lasted only a few minutes before it was declared to be over. Static crackled from the sergeant's walkie-talkie and a voice mumbled, &quot;It's over. Fuck those guys. We run this town now.&quot; A few stray shots still rang out every now and then, but they apparently had no bearing on the larger state of affairs. Each of those single shots was followed by crushing bursts of machine gun fire from three or four separate guns.</p>

<p>Static emanated from the sergeant's walkie-talkie again. He unclipped the device from the strap of his backpack and raised it to his ear.</p>

<p>&quot;Sergeant,&quot; growled a voice on the other end. The walkie-talkie must've been a cheap device because the voice sounded like it had been transmitted through a styrofoam cup into a string from the moon.</p>

<p>&quot;Sergeant, sergeant, pick up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said the sergeant.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you secured Klust?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you have a body bag for his remains?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's alive, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No shit?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No shit, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is he there with you now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Put him on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>He handed the device to me. It was constructed out of primary blue and yellow plastic<span class="mdash"></span>a children's toy.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir?&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;You must hold down this button to speak, sir,&quot; the soldier pointed out.</p>

<p>I held the button down. &quot;Sir?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Klust,&quot; the general said. &quot;We have won this battle. We have yet to win the war, but we will win that also. The mutineers have been vanquished. Any still alive will not be alive for long. I will shoot them myself if I have to.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's good to hear, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you located the immune?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She is nearby.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Were you able to set eyes on her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And? Is she an actual immune?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it appears so, sir. But I was<span class="mdash"></span>&quot;</p>

<p>He was impatient and cut me off. &quot;That's good news, Klust. You've done good work.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now I want you to take my men to find her. She is ours. Victory is ours.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir. Sir<span class="mdash"></span>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No time, Klust.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just one question, sir. How did you know<span class="mdash"></span>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We tailed the police, who tailed you. Obviously. Put the sergeant back on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>The soldier put the walkie-talkie back to his ear.</p>

<p>&quot;Sir, yes, sir!&quot; he shouted.</p>

<p>&quot;Today,&quot; the general's voice crackled, &quot;we are not just saving ourselves. We are saving all of humanity. Let Klust lead the way. Find the immune. Get the job done.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sir, yes, sir!&quot;</p>

<p>The walkie-talkie fell silent. The general had disconnected<span class="mdash"></span>or perhaps the batteries had died. The sergeant stared at me, his eyes glistening like those of a plastic toy doll molded into eternal bliss, waiting for someone to flick a switch on his back so the lights would light up.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>I scratched my way through the branches. My clothes were soaked in mud; I was drenched and cold. The scrapes where vines had cut my hands stung.</p>

<p>I found the door that Madeleine had entered. It was a black door, made from heavy wood painted a glossy black at the top of a set of concrete steps. The windows on either side of it<span class="mdash"></span>every window of the whole tenement, actually<span class="mdash"></span>were boarded up with plywood.</p>

<p>&quot;This one,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>The soldiers stepped ahead of me. They tried the door knob and found it was locked. One of them stepped up with a battering ram, the same toy that Puckwood enjoyed using. It took three hits for the door to be loosed from its hinges<span class="mdash"></span>I supposed Puckwood might've done it in one, but I kept my mouth shut. The fourth hit slammed it inwards. The soldier with the ram stepped aside and his buddies swept into the building one after another.</p>

<p>By the time I followed they had secured the first floor. Their torch beams illuminated the open doorway that led down to the basement on the right-hand side of the main room and the open doorway at the far end of the room that led to stairs heading up to the upper floors of the building.</p>

<p>The gaze of each soldier was turned towards me. I was supposed to tell them the way to go next. They were robots awaiting a command. I hadn't the faintest clue what to tell them.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>But after a moment's hesitation it was obvious. Madeleine may have spent the past year or more in hiding, but she was not actually the type to hide. She was ashamed of nothing; she lived without regrets. She was not afraid to bare everything, warts and all, as the expression had it.</p>

<p>&quot;Guard the cellar,&quot; I said. &quot;Make sure nobody comes out of there. If anybody does, shoot them.&quot;</p>

<p>The sergeant nodded the sack on his head towards one of his men and that man stepped towards the cellar door.</p>

<p>&quot;She's upstairs,&quot; I continued. &quot;Sweep it floor by floor until you reach the top. Shoot anyone who isn't Madeleine. She's female, five-foot-two, brunette. Still supposed to be pretty. We want her alive. To hell with anyone else. Is that clear?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sir, yes, sir!&quot; they shouted in one great voice.</p>

<p>They charged up the stairs. I followed.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>Each floor had two apartments, one on either side the stairwell. The soldiers cleared each apartment on each floor simultaneously, sending two men into each apartment while the sergeant kept watch in the hall.</p>

<p>&quot;Clear!&quot; the men shouted after ensuring each room was empty of people.</p>

<p>&quot;Clear! Clear!&quot; </p>

<p>And then the roar of five shots boomed off the walls of the small building.</p>

<p>Someone had still been alive in an apartment on the third floor.</p>

<p>&quot;Clear!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What happened?&quot; the sergeant growled into the apartment's open doorway.</p>

<p>A man's body lay spread on the ground. He wore brown pants and a brown sweater and his bare feet were encrusted with mud and his head looked like a giant glob of mud. All five shots had landed in the man's chest, tearing a great cavity out of it. A great puddle of blood was already spreading out from underneath him and across the floor. The sergeant glanced back to me.</p>

<p>&quot;Not Madeleine,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>The sergeant stepped back into the hallways.</p>

<p>&quot;Next floor!&quot; he ordered.</p>

<p>The men charged. Almost immediately came shouts: &quot;Don't move! Hands in the air! Don't you fucking move!&quot;</p>

<p>The sergeant and I rushed up the stairs.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>Madeleine was seated near the apartment's alcove window. Her back was arched bolt upright in a stiff, dark-lacquered dining chair. Her gaze was directed at the wall across the room so that from my position, as I stepped into the apartment, her face was in profile. She was as still as a tree although I had the impression<span class="mdash"></span>call it an intuition<span class="mdash"></span>that she had been just as still before the soldiers had stormed the room and commanded her to be still. Her expression, as glimpsed from across the room, was as serene as the face of a statue of Buddha.</p>

<p>I stepped into the room, slipped around the sergeant, and through the gauntlet of guns. The torches of the soldiers waved all about the room which otherwise was cast in shadows. The street lamps outside no longer functioned and almost no light entered the room from the street. I stood before her. I took out my torch from my jacket packet, illuminated it, and directed its light into her face.</p>

<p>Her hair was still lush and black, full and flowing. Her face, overall, still retained a perfect oval shape; seen up close it as round, beautiful, and demure as the Mona Lisa's. Her eyes, blue and vivid, stared back into mine without flinching.</p>

<p>Small cracks were evident upon her ears. The lobes were as thin and attenuated as paper. The ball of her nose was just beginning to crumble, her cheeks to disintegrate, her lips to ossify; soon they would simply fall off like an old scab leaving her teeth perpetually bared to the world as if she were a screeching chimpanzee. Her skin was losing its color, its warmth, beginning to harden and scale. Her neck was withering like an old turtle's.</p>

<p>&quot;She's not immune,&quot; the sergeant observed. &quot;What a fucking waste of time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just take her away,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;We should just shoot her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Take her away! She lasted longer than you or me. Maybe she'll be of some use after all.&quot;</p>

<p>The soldiers took her away. They grabbed her under the armpits and carried from the apartment and down the stairs as if
she were nothing more than a heavy bag of garbage.</p>

<p>A minute later I followed. There was no longer any rush.</p>
