<p>It was a sunny, nearly cloudless day in the springtime, and yet even the shadows in the park beneath the great plane trees and the rose bushes had an ominous foreboding about them, as if something dead had been hidden inside each pocket of darkness. Of course I knew that such anxieties were perhaps little more than a quirk of my own mind. In this instance, I decided the quirk might've been on to something.</p>

<p>The buildings that surrounded the park were predominantly apartment buildings, cheap walk-ups for the most part, some as high as six or seven stories, with satellite television dishes rusting off of flimsy-looking fire escapes, the facades composed of dull bricks caked with a century's worth of grime. There were dozens of such buildings fronting the park, which meant hundreds of apartments and probably thousands of windows. And yet each and every one of those windows was dark. If there was one that had a light on inside it would have been as conspicuous as the moon on a cloudless night.</p>

<p>Puckwood apparently felt the same way I did. He grabbed his shotgun from the vehicle and stuffed his coat pockets full of spare shells and made sure to lock the doors. He stood tall, a wildebeest on the savannah, slowly shifting the eye holes of his sack so that his gaze cascaded across a wide swath of the buildings.</p>

<p>Eyes still facing outwards, towards danger, he said, &quot;What now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let's take a walk,&quot; I said.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>I led the way. Puckwood followed ten steps behind. I suppose we must have appeared from a distance like a man walking his dog (that would be me in this analogy) on a long leash, except it was Puckwood who jittered about frantically, turning left and right constantly, attempting to peek into every window of every building above us all in the same moment. Either he was really high on something strong or else he didn't like this situation in the least.</p>

<p>We exited the park and crossed the street. We sauntered in the shadow of a large apartment building whose dark brown bricks loomed straight up above us like the wall of a deep canyon that we were at the bottom of. Across the street, two-story row houses sagged on their foundations, brooding behind their darkened windows, like the sleeping heads of a troop of decapitated giants. We paused before the front doors of the apartment buildings and gazed through the dusty glass into the lobbies. No one was about. No lights were on.</p>

<p>We continued. By the time we reached the end of the block, we had seen no one else at all.</p>

<p>Far down the street, three or four blocks away, an occasional car passed through an intersection. Between here and there, there was no one<span class="mdash"></span>no cars, no people, not even a stray mutt moping around.</p>

<p>There were birds all about<span class="mdash"></span>lots of pigeons, of course, lined up along the edges of the building roofs, but also petite chickadees and titmice as well as bluebirds and bright red cardinals, birds that were hardly ever seen in the city until recently. Here, it was was as if they had replaced all the people, or even as if the people had turned into birds.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>We circled the whole block and returned to where we had started. It was all the same. No one was about and all the windows were dark.</p>

<p>I suppose because it had an electric light blinking at the entrance, the subway<span class="mdash"></span>which had been all but invisible a quarter of an hour before, incongruous and normal as it was<span class="mdash"></span>seemed the most obvious place to check out next. The blinking came from the basketball-sized green bulb atop the green steel post that was ubiquitous in the city because at least one marked the entrance of every subway entrance. That blinking light was the only sign of life<span class="mdash"></span>of human life, that is<span class="mdash"></span>anywhere around. Of course it looked like a trap. It was almost the textbook definition of a trap: a blinking light (the bait) over a big hole in the ground (the trap).</p>

<p>&quot;Should we do it?&quot; said Puckwood.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; I answered, &quot;but we will anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever.&quot;</p>

<p>We each had a last leisurely cigarette. It was broad day light, early afternoon. A lack of sound<span class="mdash"></span>of human-made sound, anyway, since the birds were noisy<span class="mdash"></span>accompanied the darkened windows. No music seeped out of any buildings, no cars<span class="mdash"></span>at least none within blocks or that could be seen<span class="mdash"></span>honked or backfired or rumbled, and no one yelled or sang or spoke. The only sound was the wind ruffling the dry leaves in the tree limbs above our heads and the birds chirping as they flittered about in the trees or snacked on seeds or whatever they ate in the grass. It would have been a beautiful scene, something out of a nineteenth-century painting in some fogy old museum, except for the fact that it was squat in the middle of one of the largest cities on the planet<span class="mdash"></span>which just made it spooky.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>Dead leaves and mud were caked into the corners where the steps met the walls of the stairwell. Glass scraped against concrete with each step we took because the steps were covered with shards from broken bottles. Sunlight reached a small space at the bottom of the stairwell, illuminating the pipe of a handrail beside another set of steps that led even further down, but beyond that meagre space there was nothing but darkness, as impenetrable as a wall.</p>

<p>We clicked our torches on and aimed the light parallel to the barrels of our guns straight ahead of us. The position was called the Harris technique and it didn't take long for your arms to groan in pain using it but I was not about to let my guard drop. I actually had no good reason at that point to believe we were in serious danger<span class="mdash"></span>or at least any danger more serious than normal. There were a lot of images of Madeleine outside, a conspicuous lack of human activity, but nothing else. Whatever it was that caused the feeling of dread, or the bad omen, or whatever it was, Puckwood felt it also. He was actually crouching as he stepped forward, his steps as soft and slow as a ninja's.</p>

<p>To our left was the ticket booth, to our right the turnstiles and the black metal bars of the gate that blocked access to the train platforms. The space was empty save for dust and leaves and glass shards. In the corners cardboard boxes had been tossed and flattened. Even the homeless people had found better lodgings.</p>

<p>We peaked through the glass of the ticket booth, illuminating the space within with our torches: two pedestal chairs with green cushions, a pair of black telephones, notebooks and pens and various such items on the desk surface. There was nothing unexpected.</p>

<p>Beyond the turnstiles, another set of steps led down to the train platform<span class="mdash"></span>or at least I assumed, since the light of our torches did not reach down that far. It was so dark that the darkness appeared as something solid, a giant creature with enormous mass, entirely opaque and implacable. Sounds of dripping water and a smell of rusting iron<span class="mdash"></span>but nothing else<span class="mdash"></span>emanated from the stairs.</p>

<p>&quot;Should we go down?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;It's just a fucking subway,&quot; said Puckwood. &quot;Just rats.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Probably so,&quot; I said. &quot;Maybe we should head back.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fuck it,&quot; he said, &quot;let's get this over with.&quot;</p>

<p>I followed his lead. Gripping his shotgun and his torch in one hand, with the other he grabbed the side of the turnstile and hopped over. I did likewise.</p>

<p>Stairs led down to the train platform. It was a small station that served only one train line and the platform was raised between tracks that led uptown on one side and downtown on the other. We descended the steps slowly. The platform would have been long enough to serve trains with ten or even eleven cars, which meant the underground space we had entered was enormous, the platform itself over six hundred feet long. Tunnels stretched away into the abyss at either end. In such a cavernous space, the light of our torches was feeble and pathetic. It cast a dim yellowish haze over an area no more than ten or twenty feet wide. Nothing at all could be seen behind the haze.</p>

<p>When we reached the bottom of the steps and stepped onto the platform, I glanced back. A hint of light from the afternoon outside filtered onto the landing above us at the top of the steps in a dim pale fog; in this place, otherwise cut off from the rest of the world, that light was the only clue that the external world still existed. And then it went it out. There was a loud crash of metal against metal that echoed throughout the enclosed space. I blinked and opened my eyes extra wide; the light had been faint so perhaps, for only a moment, I had simply lost sight of it. There was a sound of steel parts clanking off another one, then the unmistakable clang-clang-clunk of a heavy chain being laced through iron bars.</p>

<p>&quot;Somebody just locked us in,&quot; said Puckwood.</p>

<p>&quot;Sounds that way,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;We're fucked.&quot;</p>

<p>He pumped his shotgun although there was nothing visible to shoot. The din of steel on steel hammered throughout the vast empty space.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>We stood at roughly the middle of the platform<span class="mdash"></span>where the center cars of the train would be if trains still stopped here. In normal times there would be lights in the tunnels, visible from a good distance: a red light instructing engineers to prevent their trains from moving forward, white lights to allow maintenance personnel to find their way, fainter yellow bulbs over doors and tool sheds. There would be lights over the platforms as well, bulbs in ceiling fixtures protected by cages of steel mesh. Digital sign boards would flash and animate. If there had been people about, the back lights of their phones would glare and flash. Now the darkness, aside from the virtually useless haloes cast from our torches, was absolute.</p>

<p>Neither of us moved. There was no sound except for the drips of water from leaky pipes into puddles between the tracks. The air smelt of rust and wet iron and mud.</p>

<p>&quot;Lights out,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; said Puckwood.</p>

<p>&quot;Lights out.&quot;</p>

<p>I flicked my torch off. Puckwood did likewise. It was just a hunch, an intuition, nothing more. At least a minute, perhaps several minutes, passed before my eyes stopped seeing pale afterglows of the illumination that our torches had stopped casting, and they were able to consume in its unadulterated form the perfect and omnipresent blackness that surrounded us. Only then were we able to notice the rectangular outline of a door on the far side of the tracks.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you see that?&quot; asked Puckwood.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; I said. &quot;Let's go.&quot;</p>

<p>We re-illuminated our torches and climbed down off the platform, setting our feet carefully into the muck beside the tracks. I had no idea if the third rail was still live or not, but neither of us had any reason at that moment to chance it, so we each took a humongous step over it.</p>

<p>The door was rusted steel and cold to the touch. There was a key hole but no knob to turn. The hinges appeared to be rusted solid. Puckwood stepped around me, thrust his shoulder into it, and, with a high-pitched whine of heavy metal scraping rusting metal, the door swing out and open.</p>
