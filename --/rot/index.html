<p>Every person down on the street sported a sack over their head, cinched at the neck so the wind wouldn't carry it
  off. Atop the sacks, the men wore fedora hats or baseball caps, the women wigs. Everybody smoked cigarettes. The butts
  protruded out of holes in the sacks where their mouths should've been.</p>

<p>I picked a pack of smokes off the sill, shook one out, stuck it between my lips and lit it. It's not that it tasted
  all that great, in and of itself, but it made my mouth smell less bad. My breath stunk like a sick dog had shat down
  my throat. It was one of the symptoms of the Disease. Everybody had the Disease, which meant everybody's face was
  disintegrating like a leftover pie that had been lost in the back of a fridge for years, and so everybody hid their
  ugly mugs beneath sacks. Also the Disease made everybody's breath reek like death, and so everybody smoked because it
  was the only thing strong enough to mask it.</p>

<p>Across the room the cat lay curled up on the sofa. He was just a black-and-white cat, a tuxedo as they were called,
  not any kind of special breed or special in any way at all, but neither was I. I had had him since he was a kitten and
  we were buddies. He'd always been a bit scrawny, a bit runty<span class="mdash mdash--mono"></span>kind of like me, I suppose.</p>

<p>Mostly he ignored me now, except to meow at me when he was hungry. He used to squish up against my legs or bump his
  snout under my fingers so I'd pet his head or stroke his chin, but now he never bothered. His behavior had changed
  after I started showing symptoms. I doubt he cared what I looked like, although I'm sure he noticed the smell.
  Apparently cats can smell as well as dogs but training them is hopeless.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Max,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>An ear flickered. His body puffed up a bit with each breath. Otherwise he might as well have been dead.</p>

<p>The phone buzzed. It was on the sill beside the pack of smokes. On the screen was an illustration of a padlock, which
  indicated the message was a secure communication from headquarters. I unlocked the device, entered my passcode, and
  was greeted with nothing more than:</p>

<pre><code>ERROR 67155
</code></pre>

<p>I sucked in a last drag off my cigarette, flicked the butt out the window and watched it spin end over end until it
  landed in the street gutter, and then lit another one.</p>

<p>At the intersection down the street a black sedan ran the red. A woman was strolling through the crosswalk, a plastic
  bag of groceries dangling from each hand. She stepped back just in time. The sedan smashed through the groceries like
  a boot through a rotten pumpkin. Eggs and tomatoes and milk and potato chips exploded. The sedan honked but did not
  even slow.</p>

<p>Puckwood called.</p>

<p>&quot;Morning,&quot; I said. &quot;You get a six-seven-one-fifty-five too?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Know what the code means?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. Do you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was hoping you would know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Means the system is broken.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No shit.&quot;</p>

<p>The phone buzzed. I lifted it away from my ear to see the screen<span class="mdash mdash--mono"></span>it was another 67155.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I just got that too,&quot; said Puckwood. &quot;Must be important. I'm headed out to the door now. Be
  there in ten.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fine.&quot;</p>

<p>I called tech help. Somebody across the world answered in an accent I could barely understand. I told him my passcode
  and user ID and he confirmed my entitlements.</p>

<p>&quot;What can I do for you, Mister Crust?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I got a six-seven-one-fifty-five.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am sorry but can you repeat that, Mister Crust?&quot;</p>

<p>I repeated it.</p>

<p>&quot;Six, seven, one, one. What was the last number?&quot;</p>

<p>We went back and forth on the numbers until he got it.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Mister Crust, the system is working perfectly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It says it's an error.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because you are not at your desk, Mister Crust.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When you attempt to read the message on an authorized system device, there will be no error message, Mister
  Crust. You are currently not using an authorized system device.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What would be an authorized system device?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your terminal, Mister Crust. Do you not have a terminal at your desk, Mister Crust?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do but I'm not at my desk.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, I understand, Mister Crust. You must log in to the terminal at your desk, Mister Crust, in order to read
  this message.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, fine, I got it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wonderful, Mister Crust. Is there anything else I can help you with today?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you for calling tech help, Mister Crust. Would you mind staying on the line for a brief survey?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've got to go and get to my desk, remember?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, excellent point, Mister Crust.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you. Bye.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Goodbye also to you, Mister Crust. Have a wonderful day.&quot;</p>

<p>I pulled on pants and buttoned up a shirt and knotted a striped tie but kept the knot loose. Only after I pulled a
  clean sack over my head and tucked the ends of it into my shirt collar did I tighten up the knot. Who ever would've
  thought that, at the end of the world, ties of all things would find a practical purpose.</p>

<p>The phone buzzed. It was a text message from Puckwood: &quot;Downstairs.&quot;</p>

<p>I took a leak in the bathroom but that was the end of my personal hygiene measures. A toothbrush stood in a cup but I
  hadn't used it in weeks. At the door I finished the routine: shoulder holster, service weapon with extra clips, jacket
  and badge, fedora, sunglasses. It wasn't sunny out but one of the advanced symptoms of the Disease was that light
  became painful to bear; the glare of sunlight was like a dozen needles jammed into your eyeballs.</p>

<p>A last glance around the place<span class="mdash mdash--mono"></span>oven was off, lights were off<span class="mdash mdash--mono"></span>for who knew how long it'd be before I returned. It
  was a small place, a mere studio the landlord had bisected with a thin wall to transform it into an even smaller
  one-bedroom. I suppose if it had burned to the ground, it would have been no big loss<span class="mdash mdash--mono"></span>save the cat, of course. I
  stepped out, bolted the door, and was off.</p>
