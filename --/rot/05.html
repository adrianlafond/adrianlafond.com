<p>&quot;That's from six months ago,&quot; I said to Puckwood.</p>

<p>&quot;Who's Zadie seven-seven-nine?&quot;</p>

<p>I ran on quick search on the username. Full name, photo, last known address flashed onto my screen. Puckwood pulled a wild U-turn in the middle of the block and floored it down an empty side street at eighty miles per hour, rocketing past stop signs and red lights. We weren't actually in all that much of a hurry; it just made him feel better, I suppose.</p>

<p>&quot;I bet she's lying,&quot; said Puckwood.</p>

<p>&quot;Who?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Madeleine. Like, wishful thinking. I've never heard of anybody not turning, anywhere.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Supposedly there are cases,&quot; I said. &quot;Rare but true. You never see them because we grab them the moment we hear about them. Off the streets and into labs. She's right about that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The rest of us need to live,&quot; said Puckwood, &quot;so some people are just going to have to suffer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's one way to look at it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All the scientists in Antarctica,&quot; said Puckwood, pausing only to light another cigarette off the butt of the last, &quot;without physical contact with anybody else for, like, a year<span class="mdash"></span>boom, their faces all melted off at the same time as everybody else's. They found tribes in Brazil, in the Congo, in places like that, who never came into contact with the rest of us dirty scumbags, where all the people's faces melted off, just like the rest of us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's true,&quot; I said. I used to read the news, too.</p>

<p>&quot;They says it's been with us for years, lying dormant, waiting for the right moment. Whatever the hell it is<span class="mdash"></span>a virus, they say. Like the flu, but worse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But worse,&quot; I agreed.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>The sky ahead, between the buildings on either side of the road, suddenly became as dark as dusk.</p>

<p>&quot;Fire,&quot; said Puckwood.</p>

<p>And just like that, we were stuck. The roads had been empty only minutes before but now it seemed every car in New York City was parked in front of us. The city no longer had anything like rush hour, nor peak times, nor off-peak times<span class="mdash"></span>just an unpredictable mishmash where anything could happen at any time at all.</p>

<p>We were too far away to see any actual flames in any building or automobile. Smoke darkened the sky and that was all. Static belched out of the police scanner because, as usual, the network was down. Cars and trucks were parked or abandoned to a standstill blocking the path before us. Within seconds we were boxed in from behind as well.</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever,&quot; said Puckwood.</p>

<p>We smoked cigarettes and reclined the seats and waited it out. Puckwood watched porn on his phone. At least he kept the volume down. His thing apparently was mostly straight normal stuff<span class="mdash"></span>one man fucking one women. The man and the woman both always wore sacks over their heads. Yes, sometimes I peeked over his shoulder; it's not like he cared or made any effort to hide it. Once, I suppose for kicks, he loaded a video of a woman jerking off a horse in some farm field somewhere. She wore rubber boots and a sack on her head and nothing else. Horses weren't susceptible to the Disease, as far as I knew, but it had a sack on its head also.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>I must have dozed off, or at least I must've been daydreaming, because I hadn't even noticed that Puckwood had exited the vehicle until I heard someone close by<span class="mdash"></span>probably the driver of one of the cars squeezed in beside ours<span class="mdash"></span>yell, &quot;Do her! Do her!&quot; and then guffaw like a bonobo. I shot my gaze out the windshield and down the block. Puckwood was hard to miss<span class="mdash"></span>nearly always the tallest fellow around, with a jet black coat. Someone much smaller than himself was pinned beneath Puckwood against the brick wall of a building. His left hand had the person's neck squeezed as if his fingers were the arms of a vice. In his right hand was what appeared to be a small gun, cocked directly towards the person's eyes.</p>

<p>I jumped out of the car.</p>

<p>&quot;Puckwood,&quot; I called. &quot;What's going on?&quot;</p>

<p>I stepped through the cars parked at the curb and onto the sidewalk. The smaller person was a female police officer. She was only as tall as Puckwood's navel. The device in his right hand was the police woman's own stun gun.</p>

<p>&quot;Puckwood!&quot;</p>

<p>Puckwood snapped his fingers open and the device dropped and clattered on the concrete. Then he let go of the woman's neck. Lastly he raised his knee high in the air before hammering his boot back into the ground with all his might. The stun gun was crushed into a hundred pieces.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, boss,&quot; he said. &quot;I was just trying to ask her what was going on.&quot;</p>

<p>I didn't reply to that.</p>

<p>He continued, &quot;She tried to stun me. I was just trying to get my badge to show her and she tried to stun me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Puckwood,&quot; I said, &quot;they may not be much of a police force anymore, but just about all of them still have guns and all of them are angry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, yeah, I get it,&quot; he said. &quot;Whatever.&quot;</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>It was almost eleven by the time we crawled out of the traffic jam. The smoke had long since dissipated. We never glimpsed or even heard a fire truck. It was just one of those things.</p>

<p>The roads were clear all the way to the condo building where Zadie779, according to all the most recent financial and governmental records, resided. Someone was exiting just as we were climbing the front steps, so we didn't even have to break the door down to gain entry. It was a luxury building, almost brand new. The walls were painted hot pink, the floors gleamed with black tiles, and, shockingly enough, the elevator was working and had even been inspected only a month before. We took the stairs anyway<span class="mdash"></span>I didn't feel like getting stuck in a box during the next blackout.
</p>

<p>Puckwood was already pulling the ram from his shoulder but I rang the bell of her condo. If Madeleine was no longer here<span class="mdash"></span>and the odds were high that she wasn't<span class="mdash"></span>I wanted to win Zadie over into telling us where she might've gone. So even when she didn't answer after a first ring, I rang again. But we heard nothing from within<span class="mdash"></span>no patter of footsteps, no household sounds such as water spilling from a faucet or a vacuum being run. I rang a third time and waited a full minute.</p>

<p>&quot;Ok,&quot; I said to Puckwood.</p>

<p>In two hits of the ram the bolts were shattered. He kicked the door in and I entered, gun out.</p>

<p>Something smelled sickly sweet, strong enough to make me want to vomit. So, immediately, I expected to find a pet's carcass inside, or perhaps something worse.</p>

<p>It was a swanky place, all contemporary and stylish, like a photoshoot from Dwell magazine. The rug was plush and white, like the hide of an abominable snowman, and the sofa and chairs were also white<span class="mdash"></span>spotlessly so. The living room and dining room and kitchen were all part of the same large room. Floor-to-ceiling windows allowed natural light to flood in and fill the space.</p>

<p>I moved quickly to the next room, the bedroom. The bed was a queen, with eight pillows staged as immaculately as if they had been positioned in a showroom. A large painting of a nude woman hung on the wall above the bed<span class="mdash"></span>I knew nothing about art but this one looked expensive. The room was empty. I turned the handle of a door and wrenched it open<span class="mdash"></span>a walk-in closet, the wracks filled to overflowing with dresses and ladies' suits and column upon column of high-heeled shoes lining an entire wall. Like the bedroom, it was devoid of people.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh my, this one's a beauty,&quot; said Puckwood.</p>

<p>He stood in the door frame that led into the bathroom. I had stepped right past it in my haste. I padded over and glanced in.</p>

<p>Judging by by the long hair and the bracelets dangling from the wrist bones and also the narrowness of the shoulders in
proportion to the length of the body as a whole, the corpse had belonged to a woman. She lay in the tub. The water<span class="mdash"></span>brown and opaque like a big puddle of diarrhea<span class="mdash"></span>had mostly evaporated so that it barely covered the deceased's hips and feet, but a pinkish stain around the tub's side marked the depth to which the tub had originally been filled. Her head lolled to one side. Her arms dangled off the sides of the tub. A paring knife was on the floor at the tub's edge. She had evidently cut her wrists<span class="mdash"></span>months previously. She was nothing but pink cartilage rotting off bones now. Even the maggots were mostly done and gone.</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder if she looks worse dead or when she had the Disease,&quot; said Puckwood.</p>

<p>The flesh of her face had mostly dissolved. The skin left on her skull was hairless and starting to flake, like bits of old paint peeling off a wall. The cheek bones and cranium were as white as chalk.</p>
