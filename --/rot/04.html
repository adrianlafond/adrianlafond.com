<p>My boss called.</p>

<p>&quot;Pust,&quot; he said, &quot;do you have the immune?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not yet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What are you waiting for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Info. Where'd the anonymous tip come from?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you know what the word 'anonymous' means?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do. What's it got to do with us?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's beside the point.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It would help.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fine, Pust. I can trust you to be discrete?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course.&quot;</p>

<p>He hung up. I supposed that meant I was just supposed to wait. I had met him once, in person, when I was being interviewed for this job, but that was after everybody started wearing bags on their heads and sunglasses everywhere. He couldn't stop clicking his pen, over and over, click, click, click, and click. And he seemed to always be looking somewhere else, off to my left, although perhaps that was only because his sack was crooked.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>I skimmed through Madeleine's public photo feed<span class="mdash"></span>five years' worth of selfie after selfie, some of them with a scenic background of some sort<span class="mdash"></span>Manhattan from the top of the Empire State Building, the Hudson River from the top of Breakneck Ridge, the ocean at Rockaways Beach<span class="mdash"></span>but most often the background was nothing more than a few trees, an expanse of lawn in Prospect Park, a brick wall, or just a plain white wall. The photos were about Madeleine, and nothing else, and whether as a result or in spite of this fact, she was a star<span class="mdash"></span>a hundred thousand followers. All her photos received thousands of &quot;likes&quot; and compliments. People loved Madeleine, pure and simple.</p>

<p>Puckwood, peeping over my shoulder in the car, said, &quot;She's hot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yep,&quot; I agreed.</p>

<p>&quot;Or she was. I'm sure she's still hot if you throw a bag over her head.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Supposedly she still is hot. That's why we're after her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We'll see,&quot; he said, lighting another cigarette.</p>

<p>Her face was more cute than pretty<span class="mdash"></span>rounded, doll-like, enormous dark eyes, black hair that was contorted into an explosion of spikes and wires and frills but was never fashioned the same way twice. Perhaps it's a cliché from a million bad novels, but in her case it was true: her skin had the same hue and perfection as marble. In some photos she dressed up as a famous rocker from the last century: Pat Benatar, Joan Jett, Björk. In other photos she had clearly just woken up<span class="mdash"></span>or was pretending to have just awoken<span class="mdash"></span>and was sipping a mug of coffee or biting into a huge red apple. In either case, she was so beautiful that I wouldn't have been surprised to learn she was actually nothing more than a three-dimensional artwork, a digital fabrication of some sort. Her face made a sight that was difficult to tear your eyes away from.</p>

<p>Her public feed ended abruptly over a year previously. She had left no notice, no final farewell message, no explanation<span class="mdash"></span>she had simply stopped posting. If it was an attempt to hide from the authorities then it was a rather futile gesture. I exited the public feed to review the other options available<span class="mdash"></span>the kind of stuff that used to require a warrant<span class="mdash"></span>private messages, emails, phone records, video calls. Terabytes of data was accessible, all indexed and searchable. If she so much as touched anything connected to the internet, it was at my disposal.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>Puckwood and I lit cigarettes and sat in the car and smoked with the windows down. The street was mostly empty<span class="mdash"></span>no cars passed and there were only a few people about, mostly men, lounging on stoops smoking cigarettes and drinking straight out of forty-ounce bottles. They wore black balaclavas on their heads like obese fascists. The balaclavas were stretched out and loose because if anything that covered rotting heads was too tight then it was painful against skin that was already in a state of disintegration. One guy had a brown paper bag over his head.</p>

<p>&quot;Where to?&quot; said Puckwood.</p>

<p>&quot;Nowhere yet,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>I called tech help.</p>

<p>&quot;Am I speaking with Mister Crust?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Can you verify some details for me please?&quot;</p>

<p>I recited what he asked for<span class="mdash"></span>name, address, employee identification number, phone numbers<span class="mdash"></span>until my identity was verified.</p>

<p>&quot;Very good, Mister Crust. How can I assist you today?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Case sixty-seven-one-fifty-five. Do you have it there on your screen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One moment, Mister Crust.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure.&quot;</p>

<p>Half a minute of silence passed. I flicked the butt of my cigarette into the street and lit another one.</p>

<p>&quot;Mister Crust?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How can I assist you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Case sixty-seven-one-fifty-five.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I have it here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can you run a search for me, please?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will do my best, Mister Crust, to assist you however I can.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wonderful. The subject, Madeline Shrive<span class="mdash"></span>can you run a search through all her data for anything relating to her current whereabouts? Anything related to housing, moving, commuting, GPS coordinates<span class="mdash"></span>especially GPS coordinates. Do you understand?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand completely, Mister Crust. This is a standard procedure on which I pride myself. Should this search also include data considered private and confidential?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Absolutely.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very good, Mister Crust. By when you do need the results?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;ASAP.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can have the results in one hour. Will that suffice?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is there anything else I can assist with you today, Mister Crust?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at the moment.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you for calling tech help, Mister Crust, and have a most pleasant day.&quot;</p>

<p>Puckwood said, &quot;I'm starved.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We've got nothing better to do at the moment,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>He shifted the transmission out of park and pulled the car back into the non-existent flow of traffic. This wasn't our usual part of town so I opened the map on my phone to search for something that would do but, as so often these days, the network was on the blink. Puckwood cruised up and down streets, almost randomly. We must've passed a dozen restaurants that looked promising from a distance<span class="mdash"></span>diners, taco shops, a couple of Indian joints<span class="mdash"></span>until we pulled over out front of them. They all had their lights out, their security gates shut and locked over their whole fronts, or even had their windows boarded up with plywood.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe we can eat cigarettes,&quot; said Puckwood.</p>

<p>Finally we spotted a cart on the sidewalk at an intersection. Neon lights glittered and animated from a sign on its roof:</p>

<pre><code>FALAFA
HOT DOGZ
PRETSELS
SANDWICHS
</code></pre>

<p>Smoke bubbled from a pipe on its roof. The silhouette of a man's head<span class="mdash"></span>bent down over his grill<span class="mdash"></span>appeared through the window. Half a dozen people actually stood in line.</p>

<p>&quot;Holy shit,&quot; said Puckwood.</p>

<p>He jerked the vehicle into a squealing U-turn and pulled up directly behind the cart.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>The only thing the vendor had for sale was hot dogs. The rolls were toasted, perhaps only because otherwise they would've been too stale to eat. I have no idea what was in the franks; it definitely wasn't beef. They had the texture of dish sponges and tasted just as bland.</p>

<p>The crowd<span class="mdash"></span>I mean the half dozen people in line before us, since no one arrived afterwards<span class="mdash"></span>dispersed. Only the vendor and ourselves remained in sight on the sidewalk. I felt a malevolent presence emanating from him, although perhaps I merely imagined it, or perhaps he felt that way towards everybody and it had nothing to do with us specifically. His attention seemed to be directed vaguely towards Puckwood and myself. He wore a loose hood over his head and dark shades over his eyes so it was impossible to tell where he was looking, what he was thinking, whether he was even awake. Maybe he just wanted to ask questions but didn't have the gumption to ask.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>My phone buzzed. Tech help was calling.</p>

<p>&quot;Mister Crust?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Speaking.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can you verify some details for me please?&quot;</p>

<p>We went through the same charade as we did a moment ago.</p>

<p>&quot;Very good, Mister Crust. The information requested,&quot; the man said<span class="mdash"></span>and then he became silent.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is being sent to you now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can't just tell me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am sorry, Mister Crust. I cannot. Is there anything else I can help you with today?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nope.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you and have a most pleasant day.&quot;</p>

<p>He hung up. I checked my inbox but nothing new had arrived except for a bunch of surveys about my recent experiences with tech help. I deleted them. Puckwood and I smoked more cigarettes and waited.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>Puckwood shoved my shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;Wake up,&quot; he said. &quot;Your phone buzzed.&quot;</p>

<p>I checked my inbox.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; I told him. &quot;Temple of the Most Holy Redeemed Visage.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A church?&quot;</p>

<p>I told him the address. He floored it. While he drove I played back the call on the speaker. It was a woman's voice: &quot;I'd like to report an immune. Her name is Madeleine Shrive. S-H-R-I-V-E. She is immune for she has traded her very soul to the Evil One in return for temporary beauty in this world and eternal damnation in the next. She hides from the light so I cannot give you an exact location. But she can't be hard to find. She goes everywhere surrounded by a horde of idolaters for the pleasures of the flesh deceive many. Do you not think that if Satan<span class="mdash"></span>the evil one himself<span class="mdash"></span>walked among us, he too would not be immune? He also would be worshipped, he also would be adored, and from his lips also would come nothing but lies. Madeleine Shrive is evil. She leads others down the pathways of sin and damnation. Madeline Shrive. Evil.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever,&quot; said Puckwood.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>The Temple of the Most Holy Redeemed Visage was not a traditional church building at all. It was no more than a storefront with a wooden sign affixed to the door with black letters painted onto a white background. Puckwood double-parked the vehicle out front. Half a dozen people stood near the front door smoking cigarettes. They wore gray sacks but not sunglasses. From the moment we stepped out of the car they stared at us and didn't remove their eyes from us even to blink.</p>

<p>The rest of the congregation was visible through the plate glass of the shop front. There must have been a hundred people inside, all of them huddled together on the floor since there were no pews or chairs to be seen. Each of them was focussed towards something or someone at the far end of the shop. There were no lights on inside<span class="mdash"></span>only candles perched along the walls. The back of the shop was obscured by shadows.</p>

<p>&quot;Shotgun?&quot; ask Puckwood.</p>

<p>I had to think on that one. We were about to enter a small room stacked wall to wall with crazies<span class="mdash"></span>but too many crazies for even a shotgun to be of much use.</p>

<p>&quot;Leave it,&quot; I said. &quot;We'll have to just take our chances on this one.&quot;</p>

<p>He left the shotgun in its stand and locked the car doors. We approached the front door and the people in front stepped back.</p>

<p>&quot;Is there the pastor inside?&quot; I asked them. &quot;Someone who leads this congregation?&quot;</p>

<p>I glanced from face to face to face<span class="mdash"></span>meaning from one set of eyes to another. They continued to stare but nobody answered.</p>

<p>I pushed on the front door. It was so crowded within that worshippers squatting near the door had to shuffle over on their knees to make room for the door to open even twelve inches. Every single person knelt and leaned forward, their faces almost touching the backs of whoever was in front of them. All of them mumbled an unintelligible chant, a huge collective whisper, none of them even in sync with one another, creating, altogether, a deafening hum whose echoes hammered off the walls throughout the narrow space as if the entire room were an enormous engine of some kind, rumbling and grinding and building up power for some unknown purpose. The place reeked of excrement and bile and vomit<span class="mdash"></span>so much so that I felt like vomiting myself<span class="mdash"></span>but that was merely because of the proximity of so many people who were not smoking cigarettes. The worse symptom of the disease<span class="mdash"></span>even worse perhaps than people's faces rotting off<span class="mdash"></span>had always been the stench. It was downright obnoxious of people not to smoke cigarettes.</p>

<p>I stepped carefully over shoulders, letting the ball of my foot ease gently into the floor with each step. Puckwood, behind me, did the same. The worshippers seemed to pay us no mind whatsoever. It seemed an eternity before we reached the back of the shop, where no candles were lit and nothing but darkness and shadows filled the void. I stepped past the last worshipper and into the shop's only empty bit of space. I had expected to find someone here, someone filling the role of pastor or prayer leader, but there was no one there. There was not even a lectern or an altar or even a chair.</p>

<p>A crackle emanated from speakers in the ceiling. A man's voice, deep, unhurried, and patient, intoned: &quot;Once upon a time, a long time ago, God Himself addressed that evil one, Satan, 'Behold Job. All that he has is in your power, only do not put forth your hand on him.' Satan relished the opportunity to turn this man of great faith, Job, away from God. He punished him with a most foul and grievous disease. Long before our own time, Job knew what it was to experience one's very face disintegrate into a putrid filth more foul than the foulest droppings of a sick dog, to have one's own children flee in horror from their own father, to have one's own wife admonish him to kill himself. His own friends assumed his sufferings were the result of his own grievous sins<span class="mdash"></span>but Job was a man of great faith, sinless, blameless. Despite his great sufferings, he kept his faith. The evil one could not turn him. We of this congregation are Job. Despite our suffering, we have not relinquished our faith. We suffer because of the sins of others<span class="mdash"></span>the sins of perverts, pederasts, pedophiles, homosexuals, transexuals, fornicators, those who copulate with animals, with children, men who copulate with men, women who copulate with women, men who live as women, women who live as men. God gazed down upon his most transcendent creation<span class="mdash"></span>humankind<span class="mdash"></span>and was so disgusted he unleashed Satan to punish us all, every one of us, sinner and sinless alike, with this most vile torment. This is how we knew, when we witnessed one who did not suffer this plague, one who, unlike all the rest of us, whose face was perfect, unmarked, unscarred, unblemished, whole and entire, whose breath was not like something squeezed out of a dog's asshole but like the scent of flowers on a summer breeze<span class="mdash"></span>this is how we knew, instantly, that we were in the presence of Satan himself, in the guise of a woman, a beautiful woman, a seductress attempting to turn us away from our faith in God. We suffer the torments of Satan. To rid ourselves of this plague, this pestilence, this suffering, we must rid ourselves of Satan. It is the only way. Go. Go find Madeline Shrive. Destroy her. She is not a woman. She is not human. She is Satan.&quot;</p>

<p>Faces were no longer downturned. All gazed upon Puckwood and myself, black eye holes cut out of pale sacks. Set into the back wall of the shop was a door. I pushed the metal bar, the door opened, light exploded into the dark space like a bolt of lighting. We rushed out. The door slammed shut behind us. We found ourselves in a narrow alleyway, a space for trash bins and garbage and not much else.</p>

<p>Puckwood tried the door. It was locked. It took us a good ten minutes to walk to the end of the alleyway, climb a chain-link fence, and make our way back around the block to our car. The store front of the church was locked away behind a steel security gate that had been pulled down to the sidewalk. We peeked in through holes in the gate's hinges through the glass of the store front. There was nothing to see but darkness. We looked up and down the street but not a soul was about.</p>

<p>We settled back into the car and Puckwood did not wait for instructions before he took off, blasting through a red light and racing down the avenue. We'd gone half a dozen blocks before he slowed down.</p>

<p>I checked my phone. There was a new message. The search had come through.</p>
