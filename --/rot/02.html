<h1>Rot</h1>

<h2>2</h2>

<p>The car was idling in the empty space in front of the fire hydrant, exhaust puffing from its tailpipe in black clouds. It didn't have hubcaps and the black paint on its hood and roof were faded to gray, as if it were a cheap toy that had been left out in the rain. Puckwood's shotgun was propped up in a rack between the front seats. Puckwood himself was lounged back, virtually supine, his arm draped over the edge of the door, a cigarette fuming from between his fingers. It was a bit of an act<span class="mdash mdash--mono"></span>he popped pills all day long that kept him as wired as a plugged-in blow dryer dropped into a bathtub. He wore a stark white sack over his head with a shiny black fedora and glossy black shades<span class="mdash mdash--mono"></span>the tuxedo of sack heads.</p>

<p>I settled into the passenger seat and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>&quot;Where to, boss?&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Headquarters,&quot; I told him. &quot;Need to get that message.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Headquarters just for that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just for that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They need to fix that shit. Whatever.&quot;</p>

<p>He flicked his cigarette butt into the street and put the car into gear and we were off.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>The vehicles in the right lane were all broken down and abandoned so Puckwood sped down the left lane, against the flow of traffic that no longer existed. The number of automobiles increased only as we passed a big Catholic church, the kind that would have been no more than a desolate barn a few years back even on Christmas, but out front of which now the vehicles were doubleparked and the crowd was so large it spilled out the front doors and down the steps. None of the congregation<span class="mdash mdash--mono"></span>at least the members of it who were outside, whom we could see<span class="mdash mdash--mono"></span>was socializing. They were the ones who had not made it into the church itself<span class="mdash mdash--mono"></span>it was that packed. They stood facing the church<span class="mdash mdash--mono"></span>it was the best they could do, I suppose<span class="mdash mdash--mono"></span>with heads bowed, hands crossed. It was probably one of the few places left anywhere where not everybody chainsmoked.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>Puckwood pulled us up a ramp onto the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. It was difficult to believe this had once been a parking lot at almost all hours of the day. Vehicles now swept past at eighty or ninety miles per hour. Puckwood pressed his foot to the accelerator to keep up. I suppose the flow would've moved even faster if the road hadn't been a disaster of potholes and cracks and discarded tires and hubcaps and bumpers. Puckwood left the radio off and we smoked cigarettes and cruised without saying anything.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>At the station house, Puckwood bumped the front wheels of the vehicle over the curb of the sidewalk and put the transmission into park. It was the police captain's spot, but he never bothered to show up anymore and, more to the point, we outranked him anyway. We tried not to make a show of it<span class="mdash mdash--mono"></span>police could be prickly<span class="mdash mdash--mono"></span>but when you have to park, you have to park.</p>

<p>In the foyer of the station one of the fluorescent ceiling bulbs was flickering. The floor was covered an inch thick in black mud and grease, all of it stamped with boot prints. A trash can in the corner was so overflowing that the can itself was barely visible. Candy wrappers and plastic soft drink cups and styrofoam lunch boxes were dumped beside it and all around it in a small mountain of trash.</p>

<p>Against the side wall a guy who was either passed out or unconscious lay slumped on a bench. His hands were cuffed behind his back to a heating pipe that ran up the wall behind the bench. His face was nothing more than a mass of blood and cartilage and raw bone that wouldn't have been recognizable as a face at all if it weren't still attached to a skull that was attached to a body.</p>

<p>Beyond the mess was the incessant din of human beings screaming in agony. The sounds emanated from below us, from the basement where the cells were. There were no open doors that led down there from the foyer we were in, no air ducts or grills in the walls near the floor, but the racket was annoyingly loud anyway, almost as loud as if the prisoners were no further away than a room down the hall with no doors closed between them and us.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>Sargent Jefferson was posted behind the front desk. His navy blue cop uniform was flecked with ketchup and mustard stains and who knew what else. He was lounged way back with his face directed to the ceiling as if he were taking a nap. He didn't budge as we stepped up to the desk. Puckwood rapped his knuckles on the desk. Jefferson still didn't budge. It's impossible to discern whether somebody whose face is hidden under a cloth sack and sunglasses is actually asleep or just being an asshole. </p>

<p>&quot;I'm concerned for the health of this officer,&quot; I said. &quot;Can you check if he's responsive?&quot;</p>

<p>The desk was raised on a platform a couple of feet high but Puckwood, being as tall as a giraffe, reached straight across anyhow and grabbed Jefferson by the tie and jerked him forward so that all the fat on his torso bounced like an oversized water balloon into the edge of the desk.</p>

<p>&quot;Fuck me,&quot; gasped Jefferson. His head snapped up until the lenses of his shades shot in the direction first of Puckwood and then of me and he said, &quot;Fuck you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever,&quot; said Puckwood.</p>

<p>We each held our badges up but he still said, &quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Access to floor five,&quot; said Puckwood.</p>

<p>&quot;Floor five? That's special access only.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And we got special badges.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Badges or not, floor five requires approval from the captain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He ain't here,&quot; said Puckwood.</p>

<p>Jefferson took a minute to slowly and deliberately light a cigarette.</p>

<p>&quot;And how,&quot; he finally said, &quot;would you know where the captain is or isn't?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because we just parked in his spot.&quot;</p>

<p>We had to endure this same idiocy nearly every day, but this last bit of news seemed to make Jefferson hesitate.</p>

<p>&quot;Which I did,&quot; Puckwood continued, &quot;because we outrank the captain. And we especially outrank your dumb fat ass.&quot;</p>

<p>This amused Jefferson for whatever reason. A laugh erupted from his mouth hole in bursts and gasps of pale smoke since he had taken a long drag off his cigarette only a moment before. When he finally caught his breath he said, &quot;So?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So let us the fuck in,&quot; said Puckwood.</p>

<p>&quot;I told you. That needs approval from the captain. And he ain't here, is he?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>I turned away and pulled my phone out of my jacket.</p>

<p>&quot;Who're you calling?&quot; said Jefferson. &quot;The captain's out sick. He ain't gonna pick up.&quot;</p>

<p>I paid him no mind. I called my boss.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm kind of busy right now,&quot; he answered. &quot;What do you need, Pust?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Access to our desks. The police aren't letting us through.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see. Give me a minute. I will call you back.&quot;</p>

<p>He hung up. Thirty seconds later the phone buzzed.</p>

<p>&quot;Is this Inspector Klust? I am an officer in the office of the general.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Which general?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;The general who matters. Do you know why we are calling?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; I admitted.</p>

<p>&quot;Because you need help with the police. Your boss cannot help you. We can.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who you got on the line? The captain's not gonna be happy,&quot; said Jefferson.</p>

<p>Puckwood chuckled and exhaled a great plume of smoke in a gesture of celebration.</p>

<p>&quot;How's that?&quot; I asked the man on the other end of the line.</p>

<p>&quot;The world has descended into chaos,&quot; the officer replied. &quot;Absolute chaos. Only the army can restore order.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; I said. &quot;Great. And?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And what can the army do about this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We can send a platoon over. Perhaps a whole company. Tanks. Helicopters. Missiles. We will raze the building to the ground.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That could be helpful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But there are more efficient solutions.&quot;</p>

<p>Jefferson's phone buzzed. He answered it. He nodded his head. He looked up at Puckwood and myself and yelled, &quot;Go on up. Just go. Go on up and go fuck yourselves.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Unless I have misheard, your situation has been resolved.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That seems to be the case,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;The general sends his regards,&quot; the man on the other end said before disconnecting.</p>

<p>&quot;Just go already,&quot; said Jefferson.</p>

<p>He smudged his hand into something on the underside of his desk and a door to our left buzzed and above it a light flashed green. Puckwood smiled gleefully at Jefferson, like a bully who had just dumped a smaller classmate into a puddle of mud. I ignored Jefferson completely. I pushed the door open and started trudging my way up the stairs. Puckwood followed.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>&quot;Is the army coming?&quot; said Puckwood as we trudged up the stairs. &quot;Tell me the army's coming and they're gonna machine gun all these assholes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not today, apparently,&quot; I said. &quot;But don't tell that asshole downstairs that.&quot;</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>We shoved the door in off the fifth floor and stepped into a massive office space that was entirely empty but for the security guys who were always there. As always, they sat almost perfectly still, never saying a word, just staring straight ahead at us. Even when guys have canvas sacks pulled over their heads, you know when they are staring at you. It's an eerie sort of feeling. I always had the impression that an engrossing but forbidden conversation had been taking place only moments before and they were angry with me for having interrupted it.</p>

<p>One guy sat to our left, his gut bulging through a white short-sleeved shirt and overflowing into his lap as if he was a bean bag chair with legs. The other guy, to our right, was almost as tall as Puckwood but skinny as a flag pole. He wore black pants that reached no further down than his upper calfs and a dark blue shirt that looked pretty crappy with the pants, not that I knew much about fashion. They both lounged back in desk chairs with the backs reclined as far back as they would go. The surfaces of the desks beside each of them were hidden under opened bags of potato chips and pretzels and cheese crisps and plastic bottles of cola.</p>

<p>I ignored them and headed straight to my desk in the middle of the floor. Nobody else except the security guys<span class="mdash mdash--mono"></span>if such was what they actually were<span class="mdash mdash--mono"></span>was on the floor. It was just aisle after aisle of open-plan desk space and empty chairs. All the investigators were either sick or out in the field or else completely unaccounted for. All the desk people were out sick. We relied on the police for mail delivery and phone services and that sort of thing anyway.</p>

<p>Just before I sat down I glanced back. Puckwood still stood by the door, staring at the fat one as earnestly as the fat one stared at him. His arms hung loose at this sides, his knees slightly bent<span class="mdash mdash--mono"></span>he was prepared to spring.</p>

<p>&quot;Puckwood,&quot; I said, &quot;who gives a shit?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever,&quot; said Puckwood, abandoning the confrontation.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>It wasn't an especially sunny day but light spilled through the windows because nobody had ever bothered to install blinds. As we strolled down the aisle to our desks the fluorescent ceiling lights flickered on, apparently in response to our movements. Even with sunglasses the intensity of the light was overwhelming. I pulled the brim of my hat down until it rested on the top of the frame of my shades. Puckwood did the same.</p>

<p>My boss called.</p>

<p>&quot;Pust,&quot; he said. &quot;I am working on it. Hold tight.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We're in,&quot; I told him.</p>

<p>&quot;How?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The general.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The general?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Or his office.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Which general?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Apparently, the general who matters.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That general. Do not trust that general. Trust me on this, Pust. There are all kinds of subterfuge going on right now. Secret factions, secret wars. Things even I do not understand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;It is a war of all against all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whose side are we on?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You just need to worry about the role to which you've been assigned. Nothing more, nothing less.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I get it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With some luck, we will make it out of this. Alive. On top.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Out of what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If he calls,&quot; my boss finished, &quot;hang up. Just hang up, Pust.&quot;</p>

<p>He hung up.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>I sat down at my terminal and logged in. My inbox was overflowing with my colleagues' out-of-the-office notices. I skimmed past them to find the important message; it wasn't hard because the subject line was bold and bright red:</p>

<pre><code>POSSIBLE IMMUNE
</code></pre>

<p>This meant there was a report of a person out in the city somewhere who was immune from the Disease<span class="mdash mdash--mono"></span>and it was our job to pick her up. I paused just long enough before the screen to glimpse a photograph of a beautiful woman, a brunette, with gorgeously full lips, sparkling blue eyes, rosy cheeks. It was mind-bending to consider that a human might exist who still looked like that in this world. </p>

<p>I forwarded the details back to my phone and stood up. Puckwood, his feet crossed at the ankles on the desk at his own terminal, smoked a cigarette and watched a porn flick: two sweaty people naked except for sacks on their heads, fucking doggy style. </p>

<p>&quot;Ready?&quot; he drawled. </p>

<p>&quot;Ready,&quot; I said.</p>
