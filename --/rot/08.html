<p>Puckwood led the way up a set of concrete steps, his shotgun jutting out from his shoulder like the horn of a rhino readying to charge. The dingy gray light of an afternoon that had gone overcast seeped through a canopy of branches and vines that arched over the stairwell. The steps themselves were chipped and falling apart, every crack and notch a planter for a pack of weeds, the flat surfaces of the steps and walls slippery and damp with moss. The air reeked of dank soil. The blurred black shadows of small birds flitted about from tree limb to tree limb above us, calling to each other in high-pitched tweets<span class="mdash"></span>a sound I could not help but notice, even as we tiptoed our way into what could only have been some sort of lethal trap. Birds, like clean air and non-mutilated faces, had all but vanished from the parks and buildings of the rest of the city.</p>

<p>Through the branches high above our heads, the bare sky was visible<span class="mdash"></span>the stairwell, as narrow as a doorway and as deep below street level as it was, was outdoors. Just before reaching the step at which his head would have jutted above the stairwell's rim, exposed to whomever might have been above, waiting and watching, if anyone was there at all, Puckwood paused. He glanced back at me. I kept silent. We listened. The only sounds were those of the birds and of the leaves in the trees as the chill air of a breeze cascaded through them.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and turned his gaze back towards the top of the stairwell. In three quick steps, each as light as a cat's, he bounded out of the stairwell and into a crouch on the ground above. Perhaps not as deftly, I followed.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>We saw no one<span class="mdash"></span>at least no one human. The area<span class="mdash"></span>at least as far as we could see, for the area was completely overgrown<span class="mdash"></span>was the same space that must have once been divided into separate yards behind apartment buildings and townhouses. Now there were neither fences nor walls. The branches of the trees were left to grow and spread in whichever direction they willed. Vines dripped off them as thickly as if they were the threads from a single fabric of an enormous blanket that had been dropped over the entire space by the hands of a giant. The sky peeked through in holes and patches, but the light must have been the light of dusk all day long. If there had once been manicured lawns or grass, no evidence of them remained. Bushes that had sprouted into enormous configurations as large as houses covered all the space between the trees. Birds and squirrels flitted in and out of this space. The only clue that humans<span class="mdash"></span>at least occasionally<span class="mdash"></span>ever visited were the sparkling eyes of cats reflected back at us from their hiding spots amongst the trees and bushes. If they had been completely unhabituated to humans, I suppose we would not have glimpsed them at all.</p>

<p>We shone our lights into the undergrowth. We directed the light into the tree limbs above us. We glimpsed nothing unexpected<span class="mdash"></span>merely leaves, dirt, weeds and vegetation of all kinds. The area was surrounded on all sides by the backs of four-, five-, and six-story buildings, but what windows could be glimpsed through the overgrowth were boarded up.</p>

<p>Puckwood's light picked out a path through the bushes. It was just a bit of tamped-down mud, not more than a few hands'-breadth wide, scraped out between overhanging vines and tree limbs. We could see no more than a few yards ahead<span class="mdash"></span>beyond that everything merged into a green gloom. Meagre though it was, it was the only path forward. Puckwood stepped into it, crouching like a mantis. I waited until he had gone five or so paces ahead. Then I followed.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>The ground was divided into rows of humps and troughs, a foot high or a foot deep, and the puddles in the troughs were three inches deep with mud that was as slippery as an eel's back. The humps were long, seven or eight feet or longer, often extending so far into the undergrowth that their ends could not be discerned.</p>

<p>&quot;The fuck?&quot; Puckwood cursed in a whisper.</p>

<p>It occurred to me at that moment that we were stepping over graves. That's also the moment I realized we were being watched<span class="mdash"></span>and by eyes very close by, close enough to reach out and touch us. The people were dressed in rags that were covered in mud, lathered with it, until they were as natural in that place as the tree trunks and the bushes. They did not wear sacks on their heads. Their faces were soft, glistening potatoes, deformed tubers that would have been better off buried deep in the earth. Their eyes were open.</p>

<p>Puckwood, just ahead, stopped in mid-crouch. He had noticed the people also. He did not move or even flinch. Neither did I. Except for the birds, silence reigned supreme. The wind had stopped so that the leaves did not rustle. For a minute, even the birds stopped twittering and fluttering. The people around us did not move either. We waited.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>I was not grabbed; I was caressed. It felt, in fact, more like a cool breeze running over my arms and down the back of my neck than like the touch of a person. It was only the stench, the smell of excrement wafting on the breath of the dozen or more humans who surrounded me, that shocked me out of my stupor. By then it was too late.</p>

<p>For Puckwood, it was a different story. He was, of course, a much larger person than myself. He fought and struggled, bashing someone in the skull with the butt of his gun<span class="mdash"></span>an action that combined a loud thud with a sharp crack. Finally a resounding blast shattered the ethereal stillness of that wild space. A man stood before Puckwood for a moment, and the next moment there was no man at all<span class="mdash"></span>merely a torso, without a head, tumbling to the ground. Blood as black as a pile of bats spurted straight up from the ragged edges of the man's fat neck. The sudden flutter of every bird in that place, all of them at once, made a commotion as if a thunder storm had just broken open. Because of the shock of it all, I suppose the hands of the humans who remained alive around Puckwood were loosened. He leapt forward and away, climbing into the lower and then the upper limbs of a tree with the agility of an orangutan, too quickly to be caught.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll come back,&quot; he shouted. &quot;Hang tight.&quot;</p>

<p>And then he was gone.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>Of course I struggled, but the effort was futile. My fingers were cranked one by one off the butt of my gun and it was lifted from my hands. My feet lost contact with the ground as my body was lifted straight up into the air as if I were a balloon. Twigs stung and scratched my face as I ascended through the tree limbs. In my fright, in the shock of it all, I barely the noticed as the hands were replaced by ropes and bands that were cinched tight about my ankles and wrists and waist. My left arm was wrenched across my chest. My right arm was pulled straight into the air above me. My left leg was yanked far out and away, my right was pulled down and below me. I could do no more than wriggle helplessly. My body flipped halfway upside down as my neck lolled back until I gazed upwards at the graves in the earth. I was high enough to glimpse across half the expanse of that urban wilderness, across hundreds of graves under the trees.</p>

<p>The hands removed themselves from me. The people disappeared as silently as they had appeared in the first place, vanishing as smoothly as shadows when clouds obscure the sun.</p>

<p>Gun shots rang out<span class="mdash"></span>the sharp clack, clack, clack of hand guns, which were the primary weapons carried by the police, not the military. I waited<span class="mdash"></span>hoped<span class="mdash"></span>to hear the retort of Puckwood's shotgun, but only more pistol shots rang out. Then I realized why Puckwood had not fired during his escape through the trees<span class="mdash"></span>he had traded the gun away<span class="mdash"></span>had let his pursuers have it<span class="mdash"></span>in exchange for freedom. He had released the gun in order to free his hands so he could climb.</p>

<p>The heavy thump-thump-thump of a helicopter drowned out all other sounds. I did not know whether it heralded the police or the military until I discerned, beyond and out of sync with the first helicopter, the din of a second and then a third. The police did not have many helicopters and those they did have always travelled alone. Only the military sortied in packs.</p>

<p>The forest grew dark. Ten yards away from me a pale face glowed from the shadows. The ambient light was horrible, a fuzzy gray soup that that the world had sunken into, and it burnished everything into an indistinct haze<span class="mdash"></span>but even so the face appeared perfect, the cheeks glowing rouge and healthy, the lips full and pink, the eyes blue and vivid. The woman whose face it was stared at me, as if waiting for an opportune moment to speak, or perhaps to be spoken to. It was Madeleine.</p>
