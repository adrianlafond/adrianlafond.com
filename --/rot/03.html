<p>On the front step of the building, something squished under the sole of my shoe. I lifted my foot up to have a better look<span class="mdash"></span>hoping it wasn't dog shit<span class="mdash"></span>but the sole was clean. On the step, however, was a sack. It was flattened from being stomped on and sopping wet with the dirty water that pooled into black mud in all the puddles of the city. The sack had been white once but the rim of the mouth hole was brown from cigarette smoke and nicotine.</p>

<p>Halfway down the block the man who must have once been its owner waddled along the sidewalk. Half a dozen cops surrounded him, each of them a few steps away from their victim. The Disease had made him blind; he lunged forward, hands before him, arms flailing, the fingers yearning to touch something, anything. When he sensed one of the cops in front of him<span class="mdash"></span>perhaps from the sound of a giggle<span class="mdash"></span>he balled his hands into fists and swung with all his might. He was a large man, tall and built like a bull, and if any of his punches had connected some serious damage would've been inflicted. But the only thing he hit was air.</p>

<p>The man was stumbling away from us, so we just glimpsed the hairless back of his head, a swollen gumball of flesh with a gray and pasty sheen. He wore gray pants and a white shirt, all neatly pressed, and black shoes that were polished to a reflective gleam. He half-turned and his police badge<span class="mdash"></span>he was a plain-clothes detective<span class="mdash"></span>flapped from the front pocket of his shirt. He turned all the way about and we saw his face<span class="mdash"></span>or the mess where his face had once been.</p>

<p>He must have been one of the earliest victims, since cases as bad as his took four or five years to develop, and now the effects of the Disease were virtually complete. He had no hair<span class="mdash"></span>no stubble, no eyebrows, nothing. The skin had no color at all<span class="mdash"></span>it was completely gray. The entire globe of his skull had swollen to the same general size that all victims' heads swelled to, for the heads of most people swelled, especially the heads of skinny people, while the heads of the morbidly obese tended to shrink, so that in the end, as each victim's particular facial features disintegrated, everyone looked the same, and everyone looked just as awful. His ears had long since dropped off, leaving only scabrous holes on either side of his head. His eyes were almost completely white, the orbs bulging out of sockets devoid of lids or lashes. His nose, like his ears, had flaked away, leaving only a huge black pit below his eyes, bifurcated in two by a sliver of bone. Below that was perhaps the most awful thing of all<span class="mdash"></span>the mouth. His teeth had fallen out, the lips had contracted tighter and tighter, stiffer and stiffer, while the opening itself had shrunk, so that the end result was a puckered sphincter so tight he could only have been able to eat or drink after applying lubricant to a straw and plugging it in.</p>

<p>The cops glanced our way. They were just foot soldiers in dirty black uniforms. The hooting and gaffawing stopped. They obviously knew we were important, that we were also the enemy in some ill-defined manner, that we might even be able to cause them a great deal of trouble.</p>

<p>The lumbering blind man lunged towards one of the cops. He took a big swing that might've clocked the cop dead if the cop hadn't realized the danger and ducked at the last possible moment. The big man stumbled forward but did not fall. The cop who had escaped the blow tripped, did a somersault in the dust of the sidewalk, and climbed back to his feet with all the grace of a hopeless drunk.</p>

<p>Puckwood laughed out loud, a genuine belly laugh. Some of the cops tried to smile. The others glared.</p>

<p>We took the long way around, via the street instead of the sidewalk, in order to give the blind man a wide berth. Even after we settled into our vehicle, the cops kept glaring at us. Puckwood backed the vehicle out into the road and we drove off.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>The suspected immune's name was Madeleine Shrive. Fifteen minutes later we pulled up outside her last known address. It was a six-story walkup, an ancient, decrepit building of brick and concrete, with cracks splitting the bricks apart up and down the fa√ßade. Satellite dishes rusted on the fire escapes. Wires laced down from the roof and into holes punched into the walls beside windows. Sheets and trash bags covered the windows instead of drapes or blinds. Garbage was piled into a small mountain out front.</p>

<p>Puckwood double-parked in front of a row of cars that were literally rotting into the asphalt. They looked about as capable of movement as a ship dumped on its side in the dirt a mile inland after a tsunami. The tires of the cars were long gone and the steel of their hub caps and fenders was rusting away. I stepped up to the front door and made sure there was a buzzer for 3R. There was but I didn't touch it.</p>

<p>&quot;Battering ram?&quot; Puckwood called.</p>

<p>He stood at the back of the vehicle, gripping his shotgun in one hand, flipping his keys about with the other.</p>

<p>&quot;Yep,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>He opened the boot and leaned down to haul out the battering ram which he strapped over his shoulder. It was a cylinder of black steel that looked like a bazooka. He climbed the building's front steps and unshouldered it.</p>

<p>&quot;Whoa, whoa, whoa!&quot; somebody yelled.</p>

<p>The voice came from above. We glanced up. A man without a shirt or a sack<span class="mdash"></span>we must have caught him by surprise<span class="mdash"></span>leaned out of a window on the second floor. His skin was gray, his head was swollen, and his nose was no more than a few flecks of cartilage draped over a black hole. The rictus of his mouth was irreversibly puckered. The flesh had sunken away from his eye sockets so that he bore more resemblance to some exotic sea monster of the deep than to a human. He must've been the super. I held up my badge for his inspection.</p>

<p>&quot;I let you in,&quot; he said. &quot;Please to no hurt the door. Please no hurt.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You've got five seconds,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>He vanished from the window. A moment later he appeared behind the glass of the front door<span class="mdash"></span>he wore striped pajama bottoms and slippers<span class="mdash"></span>and unbolted the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Bummer,&quot; said Puckwood.</p>

<p>We slipped into the foyer. I turned to the super.</p>

<p>&quot;Keys to 3R?&quot;</p>

<p>He patted his pajamas and his bare chest, groping for pockets that did not exist.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, no,&quot; he said. &quot;No keys here. I get them now. You wait. You wait.&quot;</p>

<p>He ran up the stairs two at a time. We didn't wait. We climbed the stairs just behind him. At the landing his puckered mouth stretched as wide as it could in what I supposed was a form of gaping as we continued past him and up the stairs to the third floor. The hallway was bare wood that creaked under our steps. There were three doors on either side of the hall<span class="mdash"></span>gray steel, nothing fancy<span class="mdash"></span>with apartment labels applied with black stickers. When we paused, aside from our labored breathing, the building was silent.</p>

<p>I took out my handgun and aimed it before me with one hand. With my free hand tried the knob of 3R. It was locked. I stepped out of Puckwood's way. He unslung the ram and stepped up to the door. In the old days, police would've needed a warrant. They might even have had to knock first. Those days were long gone. We weren't exactly police, anyway.</p>

<p>The first hit bashed the bolt lock and the door lock off the frame. Puckwood followed that with a good kick that slammed the door in and open. I rushed in, the muzzle of my gun held straight out before me with two hands. A huge thud behind me was all the information I needed to know that Puckwood had dropped the ram in favor of his shotgun.</p>

<p>The apartment was empty. It was no more than a small room with a kitchen in one corner and a small bathroom behind an open door in another corner. The oven had only two burners<span class="mdash"></span>it was virtually doll-house sized<span class="mdash"></span>and the fridge beside it wasn't even waist high. The bathroom, because of its minuscule proportions, had only a shower, no tub. The windows were shut and the glass had a ghostly pallor to it from not having been cleaned in ages. The dust was so thick that our boots made footprints as we stepped about the space, like the first steps of children ruining the perfection of a fresh snow fall. There was no furniture.</p>

<p>The super stood in the doorway behind us. He still hadn't pulled a sack over his head.</p>

<p>&quot;How long since somebody lived here?&quot; I asked him.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&quot;A year?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Si.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Two years?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Si, maybe.&quot;</p>

<p>I pulled out my phone and brought up the last known photo of Madeleine Shrive and perched it in front of his fish eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Was it her?&quot;</p>

<p>The man leaned close. He stared. With a quick staccato burst, an audible fart escaped his mouth sphincter. It smelled so horrid that the gas actually billowed forth in a purplish cloud, although that might've been just a trick of the light.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes? No?&quot; said Puckwood.</p>

<p>&quot;Take any longer,&quot; I said, &quot;and he'll break another door down.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Si,&quot; he said at last. &quot;Si, si.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you know her well?&quot;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&quot;Any idea where she moved to?&quot;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders again. I believed him. Why in the world would he have the faintest idea?</p>

<p>&quot;The owner,&quot; he said. &quot;He be very upset about the door. Very upset.&quot;</p>

<p>Puckwood laughed.</p>

<p>I stepped to the kitchen and started searching through the cabinets. They were all empty except for dust and mouse droppings.</p>

<p>Puckwood tapped the floor gently with the sole of his boot. When he settled upon a spot that seemed promising, he took a flathead screwdriver from his jacket<span class="mdash"></span>Puckwood, a Boy Scout in spirit if not in fact, always came prepared<span class="mdash"></span>and bent down and pried the sharp end of the tool between the floorboards. The super sighed but Puckwood ignored him. After a minute of jamming it in and hammering it down in various places, he was able to lift a board up and away. There was nothing inside but wood beams.</p>

<p>&quot;You've got mold,&quot; said Puckwood to the super. &quot;You should fix that.&quot;</p>

<p>By the time we finished twenty minutes later, a dozen boards had been wrenched out of the floor, two dozen holes had been punched into the sheetrock walls by Puckwood's battering ram, the oven and the refrigerator stood in the middle of the living room, and the bathroom mirror lay shattered into a million shards on the floor.</p>
