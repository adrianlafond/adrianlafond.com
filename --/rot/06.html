<p>We ransacked the place. We wrapped towels over the sacks on our heads to mask the stench. On the verge of suffocating ourselves the entire time, we turned the place inside out.</p>

<p>Three tall bookcases lined the living room wall and we leafed through every book, tossing aside bookmarks and Post-It notes and even the books themselves into a great pile in the middle of the floor. I combed through the gaps between the cushions of the couch and Puckwood followed me with a switchblade and cut them to pieces, although nothing but foam fell out. While I scanned the walls looking for any signs of recent patching or drilling, Puckwood crowbarred the stereo equipment apart with his screwdriver<span class="mdash"></span>the interiors were like drawers, and most of that type of thing were just mass-produced commodities that weren't worth the effort to steal anymore, making them fine places to hide documents or narcotics or some other contraband in a pinch<span class="mdash"></span>but we found nothing interesting in them. Every kitchen cabinet was gutted and every plate and dish ended up in shards on the kitchen floor. We spilled out every can of diced tomatoes and canned fruit and every jar of spice or salt or peppercorns and every bottle of salad dressing or ketchup or wine. Half of it had gone bad anyway. About the only thing in the kitchen that remained whole was an unopened bottle of organic extra virgin olive oil<span class="mdash"></span>because that would be stupid to waste, and I needed more anyway.</p>

<p>We tore apart every shred of linen, every towel, every set of sheets, duvet, and pillow in the place. We sliced unused rolls of toilet paper and paper towels into pieces. We broke the mirrors on the bathroom walls to ensure only walls and nothing else lay behind them. We dug houseplants out of pots and dumped the soil on the floor; just about all them<span class="mdash"></span>even the cacti<span class="mdash"></span>were already dead anyway. The bed mattress was much thicker than the couch cushions so Puckwood slipped his switchblade back into his pocket and used a ten-inch kitchen knife instead. It's actually quite a lot of work to cut a queen-sized mattress apart, but Puckwood was both capable and determined. I took the mattress foundation to pieces by leaning it upright against the wall and kicking it; the wood was cheap and cracked without much effort. With another kitchen knife I hacked the paintings and prints and photos off the walls and carved them out of their frames.</p>

<p>In the end all we found of interest was a small photograph printed and placed into a small frame on the nightstand. It had been in plain view the whole time. Zadie stood beside Madeleine before an expanse of green grass and trees and some bushes that were flowering. Zadie wore a sky-blue sack over her head and was much taller than Madeline.</p>

<p>Madeleine did not wear a sack. Her face was bared to the world. She smiled. Her teeth were white and perfect, pearls between a luscious set of red lips. Her eyes were blue and glistened in the sunlight. Her cheeks bloomed with a healthy pink glow. There was nothing wrong with her.</p>

<p>&quot;Fuck me,&quot; said Puckwood.</p>

<p>&quot;Immune,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;I know where that is.&quot;</p>

<p>Puckwood stabbed a greasy finger into the photo frame's glass.</p>

<p>&quot;That building,&quot; he said. &quot;I know that building.&quot;</p>

<p>He jammed his finger against the water tower atop a tall building in the background. I cracked the glass of the frame and slipped the photo out and we were off.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>&quot;How tall do you think the stiff in the tub was?&quot; I asked Puckwood.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, then leaned his arm down to extract the cigarette lighter from the console under the dash and lit another smoke.</p>

<p>&quot;We need to be certain that's not Madeleine in that tub,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;It wasn't,&quot; said Puckwood.</p>

<p>&quot;How do you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The stiff's pussy hair was blonde. Madeleine's a brunette.&quot;</p>

<p>Rather than reply to that immediately, I took a long drag off my own cigarette.</p>

<p>&quot;Also,&quot; said Puckwood, &quot;the stiff was close to six foot. She had legs like a giraffe. Just my type. Wasn't Madeleine.&quot;</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>My boss called.</p>

<p>&quot;Pust,&quot; he said, &quot;Tell me you have the immune.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not yet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why not? What are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She cleared out of her last known address a year ago. We've got other leads we're chasing down.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You need to work faster. No excuses.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Got it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is serious. Listen to me, Pust: serious. Do you understand?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand. Completely. It's serious.&quot;</p>

<p>The line disconnected. No farewells or goodbyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Somebody high up must've given him a spanking,&quot; said Puckwood. </p>

<p>&quot;Sounds that way,&quot; I agreed. </p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>It wasn't too difficult to mark the possible parks on a map that were in the vicinity of the skyscraper that Puckwood had identified in the photo. We drove to what we thought would be the most likely site first and<span class="mdash"></span>simply enough<span class="mdash"></span>that was it. The photo had been taken in the spring when everything was lush and green and now it was autumn and everything was brown and gray and desiccated, but the view of the skyscraper peeking through the same trees that were so prominent in the photo was evident even before we pulled over to park.</p>

<p>It was a small expanse of green, half of a city block, with a gentle downward slope to it. The trees were tall, the bushes overgrown, and even in late autumn the grass needed a trim. The asphalt paths were strewn with garbage. The trash bins were overflowing. Rats leaping through the garbage paid us no mind at all. The park must've been pretty once, before the Disease, but it hadn't been maintained since.</p>

<p>We strolled down the path to the exact spot where the picture had been taken. I placed the soles of my shoes exactly where the photographer must have placed hers. Puckwood stood where Madeleine and Zadie had stood, but with his back to me, and he stared off into the distance, towards the skyscraper. He looked about in every direction and so did I.</p>

<p>&quot;There's not a damned thing here,&quot; he said. &quot;We're screwed. Where do we go now?&quot;</p>

<p>There was a poster nailed into the back of the bench a little ways further down the path. It was a print of a painting, but the sketch and the layout were one I recognized instantly since I had studied Madeleine's public photo feed only a couple of hours before. The more I glanced about, the more images of Madeleine that I saw. She was everywhere. It seemed incredible that I had not noticed the images before, but now no matter which direction I looked, Madeleine stared back at me. Once seen, she could not be unseen. </p>

<p>Puckwood turned around, probably wondering why I was silent. He looked at what he saw me looking at.</p>

<p>&quot;Well fuck me,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>There were dozens of different images of Madeleine, almost all of them prints of paintings based on photographs I had glimpsed earlier, but one image in particular predominated. It was, I suppose one could say, iconic. It was a selfie<span class="mdash"></span>in the bottom corners her shoulders and upper arms were just visible, stretching forwards towards the camera<span class="mdash"></span>taken directly from the front, straight on, and Madeleine glared into the lens, unflinching, eyes wide open, lips clenched and firm. Her expression was determined, defiant, deliberate.</p>

<p>&quot;She's everywhere,&quot; said Puckwood, turning about slowly.</p>

<p>Madeleine's image had been stapled to the wood of the bench backs, plastered onto the asphalt park paths, spray-painted onto the concrete walls of the sides of garages and buildings. It had been pasted over the metal signs on the edges of the streets where in normal times legal parking hours and street-cleaning times had been posted. It was plastered to building doors and taped to the glass of apartment windows. A version the size of a flag had been wired at its corners to stay attached to the upper reachers of a chain-link fence that bordered the handball courts in the park. It was pasted in a dozen columns and half a dozen rows onto the green bricks of the side of the small park facilities building in the layout style of Warhol's <em>Campbell's Soup Cans</em>. Her image covered over the graffiti on the side of a van and the side of a box truck parked back up on the street.</p>

<p>The sun emerged. It was a beautiful day, if a touch on the cold side. The other strange thing was that, aside from Puckwood and I and the omnipresent images of Madeleine, not a soul was about anywhere. No one strolled down the sidewalks, no cars drove down the streets adjacent to the park, no one<span class="mdash"></span>at least as far as I could tell<span class="mdash"></span>even peeked out of a window. The city had never been so quiet.</p>
