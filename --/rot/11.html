<p>I was no longer armed. Madeleine's followers or devotees<span class="mdash"></span>or whatever they were to her<span class="mdash"></span>had ripped my gun from my hands and I had not gotten it back. I smelled like I had just climbed out of a sewer<span class="mdash"></span>which, more or less, I had. Whenever I passed under a street lamp, I must've looked a horrid sight, all caked in mud<span class="mdash"></span>and worse. I walked six blocks down streets where the street lamps were mostly out and nearly all the windows were dark and, although I was in the heart of the city, everything was shadows and darkness, blacker than black. The few lights that did exist, in fact, just made everything else darker. Perhaps nobody bothered me merely because they couldn't see me.</p>

<p>But I saw other people, or at least I caught flickers of movement, or smelled them, or glimpsed the orange tips of cigarettes. People lounged on virtually every building stoop, on every front step of every building. They lounged on fire escapes and let their feet dangle off the edges. They flicked their cigarette butts towards the road or the sidewalk and paid no mind to where they landed. They crashed before me like embers jumping out of a camp fire. One even hit me on the side of the head and bounced off in a shower of red sparks onto the ground, but no one laughed and that's why I figured that whoever had done it was paying not the last bit of attention to what they were doing and had not even noticed me.</p>

<p>After six blocks I turned a corner and was confronted with an explosion of white light. It was the security headquarters for this part of the city. It was a fortress.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>An impulse to call the general clattered its way into my mind. Attack helicopters could fire rockets into the building, shattering its immaculate glass front, immolating everything and everyone inside<span class="mdash"></span>or ship-fired missiles could obliterate the entire building to nothing more than a pile of broken bricks and dust<span class="mdash"></span>or a battalion of men could storm the building from all directions, including landing on the roof, and simply shoot any and all people they found within. It all seemed so easy.</p>

<p>The general had said I needed to do it alone. This was a test. If I passed, I would be anointed a leader in the fledgling but imminent rebirth of human civilization. If I failed I would be simply forgotten, discarded like so much trash, perhaps even marked for execution if I was deemed to be worth the bother.</p>

<p>Not that it mattered<span class="mdash"></span>I didn't even have a face.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>I didn't know whether it was worth believing the general in any case. Perhaps I was marked for execution anyway, whether I failed or not. Perhaps it was all a bluff. Helicopters were at his disposal, so perhaps regiment upon regiment awaited his orders back at barracks. Then again, he had mustered little more than a platoon of foot soldiers to take Madeleine, once I had located her. If that was his army, then he was doomed. Perhaps he was doomed even if he had a million men under his command. We all were.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>Madeleine had not been an immune. No matter what I did, I suspected it was all for naught.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>Finally I just walked up to the front door of the building. I wasn't going to arrive at any better idea by just standing on the curb like a bum.</p>

<p>An unmarked black car was parked out front. It had government plates and no hubcaps, just like the beater Puckwood and I drove. The windows were tinted a shade of black that was opaque from the outside, but the driver's window was rolled halfway down<span class="mdash"></span>the vehicle had no occupants.</p>

<p>Half a dozen security cameras kept watch over the front of the building<span class="mdash"></span>as well as others I am sure I had not noticed. Whether anyone was actually watching the video feeds, at that very moment, was anyone's guess.</p>

<p>I ascended the front steps, up a flight's worth of smooth concrete, and peered through the glass down a long hallway that was blasted white with florescent light but completely empty of people. A guard booth with a dark lacquered oaken front was set about ten yards in, but it was empty. The place was eerily quiet<span class="mdash"></span>the only sound was the drone of cars blocks away.</p>

<p>I tried the door. I didn't expect it to open but it did. I stepped inside and padded over to the desk. I flipped the guest book around. The last entry bore a date from five days previous. Over the entire last page someone had scrawled a drawing of an erect cock. The artist had even drawn veins and pubic hair.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>The door that led to the stairwell was unlocked. The elevator was apparently still in service but only a lunatic would lock themselves in a box that could only be opened if there was electricity<span class="mdash"></span>not a wise gamble.</p>

<p>Once inside the stairwell, I paused. The steps were concrete, painted light gray, each step dusty with footprints in the middle but glossy on the left and right sides. This was the type of building where, until only a year or so before, almost no one took the stairs, ever, not even the maintenance crew<span class="mdash"></span>and now everybody did. I paused for a full minute or more. I heard nothing. Entirely closed off from the outside world, empty, the stairwell was deathly silent. I took the first step.</p>

<p>At each and every landing, all the way to the fifth floor, I paused. At each and every pause, I heard nothing except my own labored breathing. I smelled nothing<span class="mdash"></span>other than myself. The lights cast the same unflinching whiteness on each landing, florescent and intense, so artificial they cast a green pallor over the beige walls.</p>

<p>On the fifth floor I stepped up to the door that exited the stairwell. I needed a few minutes to catch my breath. Exercise had never been my thing and, of course, all the cigarettes had taken a toll. As on all the other landings, silence reigned.</p>

<p>There was a chance<span class="mdash"></span>virtually a certainty<span class="mdash"></span>that my boss already knew I had met with the general in person. My boss no doubt knew far more about everything than I did. I knew nothing more of the street wars happening at that very moment between at least one stray faction of what remained of the local military and at least one faction of the remnants of the city's police force than that I was a mere pawn on the board, lucky to still be on the board at all.</p>

<p>There was nothing else to do<span class="mdash"></span>I pushed the bar and opened the door and stepped forward.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>I had been in the building before but not in the past year. I stood on a gray carpet in a gray hallway. Opposite the stairwell were doors that led to the restrooms. To the left was a white door adorned with a gray plaque that read, &quot;Office Supplies&quot;. To the right was a large open-plan office space. The ceiling lights were all on but no one was about. I took a step that way.</p>

<p>The space was mostly just the same as I remembered it. Along the outer walls were conference rooms with glass doors and walls. In the corners were offices for the most important executives, also with glass walls and doors. In the middle of the room were a dozen rows of desks and chairs. Each desk had a monitor and a phone as well as assorted odds and ends that belonged to the workers who were assigned to the desk<span class="mdash"></span>coffee mugs, notebooks, pens, headsets, succulents in plastic pots. I figured if I only waited another minute, someone would appear, someone who belonged to one of the desks. At first glance, it seemed virtually impossible that someone wouldn't appear.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>A full minute drifted past, perhaps more, as I halted on the threshold of the room. I did not move. I barely breathed. If someone had actually walked in, I had no idea what I would do anyway. I was ten feet away from the nearest desk; there was nowhere to hide. I had no gun. I didn't even have a pocketknife. I stunk like a rotting sack of roadkill.</p>

<p>It was only then, at the late moment, that I realized the obvious<span class="mdash"></span>that no one would ever walk into that room, at least while I was there, or at least any time soon. A layer of dust covered everything as if under a sheet of fine gauze. I had thought the desaturated paleness of everything was a trick of the light, nothing more than my eyes still adjusting to the ineluctable brightness of the space. The insipid hue was everywhere. The dust was not quite like snow, for it was not quite white; it was more like the layer of ground concrete and who knows what else that had covered everything downtown on 9/11. No buildings had collapsed and the dust was not that thick, by any means, but it nevertheless the result of a destruction, in its own way.</p>

<p>Dust covered the telephone handsets, the backs and armrests of the chairs, keyboards, and desk tops. There were no foot prints on the floor nor tracks leading away from the wheels of the desk chairs. No one had been there in months, at the least. The lights were still on only because no one had bothered to turn them off.</p>

<p>I walked down the center of the floor, past row after row of empty desks, and at the far wall scanned the name plates affixed to the glass of the private offices. I located my boss's. I pushed in the door, leant in, and had a peek around. There was only dust, like everywhere else. Event the plant atop the desk was dead.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>I headed back to the stairwell. I went up, not down. I had no particular reason to go up, but I had no good reason to go down either.</p>

<p>The building was ten stories tall. I'd already climbed five stories, but lung capacity wasn't exactly my strong suit, and by the eighth floor I regretted by decision. But I figured I was almost there so I continued.</p>

<p>I shoved the door to the roof open. Somebody had left a cinder block on the roof just beyond the sill of the door frame for use as a makeshift doorstop and I hefted it upright to hold the door ajar. Then I strolled out into the night.</p>

<p>All the lights in the building below me may have been blaring, but three quarters of the usual lights of the city were out. The city was dark, but up above it all the night sky was blazing with stars.</p>

<p>Orange sparks glittered in the otherwise black city. They grew, metastasizing, over the next twenty minutes or so, with a mesmerizing effect that was difficult to tear my eyes away from. Entire blocks were engulfed in flames. The stars began to vanish, hidden behind smoke that was itself invisible, black against the black night sky.</p>

<p>There were no helicopters<span class="mdash"></span>the general's helicopters had left long ago, or perhaps the burning city was just not an interest to the general or to the army. There were no sirens<span class="mdash"></span>no firefighters, no police, not even an ambulance. There was no response at all that I could discern. It was all over.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>I descended the stairs back to the street and had a long walk home. I still had to feed the cat.</p>
