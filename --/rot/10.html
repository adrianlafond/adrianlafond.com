<p>I stepped out the front doorway of the building. The door itself lay on the sidewalk; the army guys had rammed it out of the frame on the way out, probably merely for the hell of it.</p>

<p>The red lights on the backs of their trucks faded into the distance. They had already taken Madeleine away. Only one truck remained, its headlights lighting up the street. The surface of the street was littered with dead bodies<span class="mdash"></span>most of them police, which a few privates were hauling and dumping unceremoniously onto the curb the same way they might've dumped a few pieces of old furniture. In a row along the curb across the street were a dozen corpses without uniforms. The feet of the corpses were bare and their clothing was stained with mud<span class="mdash"></span>they were followers of Madeleine. They lay face down. In the back of each head, in almost the same spot on each head, was a bullet hole.</p>

<p>When they were finished with the bodies on the street, the privates picked up a body off the ground behind the truck. One soldier picked up the corpse by the ankles, the other by the armpits. It was one of their own. They lifted the corpse into the truck's bed, climbed in after it, and then one slammed the outside of the truck with his open palm to signal the driver. The truck's engine groaned and roared back to life. It rumbled off in the same direction the other trucks had already taken.</p>

<p>My boss called.</p>

<p>&quot;Pust,&quot; he said. &quot;Does the general have the immune?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She's not an immune.&quot;</p>

<p>He was silent. A minute passed. I had to ask, &quot;Still there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you try to stop them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The general. His men. Who else do you think I mean, Pust?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Stop them how? They shot all the police. They shot everybody.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you still with us?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;With us? With who?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you help them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's going on?&quot;</p>

<p>He hung up.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>The street was left in darkness. The batteries of my torch were dead; I kept it off as I thought it best not to attract attention. I walked down the middle of the street in the general directiontowards where I figured Puckwood and I had parked the car.</p>

<p>At the end of the block I spotted the subway and at the end of the next block was the car. A dozen or more holes had punctured the windshield. Puckwood lounged in the driver's seat. He'd been shot so many times that there was little more than a bleeding stump atop his neck. Shotgun cartridges lay in his lap; the spare handgun he'd kept in the glove lay just beyond his fingers on the floor in front of the passenger seat. He had tried to defend himself, but it didn't look like he'd ever had a chance.</p>

<p>Headlights came into view a block away. The vehicle approached slowly as if its occupants were searching for something. The lights of a second, larger vehicle emerged behind it, creating an eerie glow<span class="mdash"></span>almost a halo<span class="mdash"></span>around the silhouette of the first vehicle. I stepped back to the curb and then behind a tree. I stubbed my cigarette out underfoot so its glow would not give me away.</p>

<p>When the vehicle came up level with Puckwood's car it stopped. It was a black limousine. The truck behind it was an army troop carrier, which meant the limousine belonged to the general. Four of five soldiers leaped from the back of the truck and ran to Puckwood's car. Light from the soldiers's torches flooded the interior, illuminating Puckwood's remains.</p>

<p>&quot;Guns, ammo, electronics<span class="mdash"></span>take it all,&quot; one of the soldiers ordered.</p>

<p>All the doors were opened. The trunk was cranked open with a crowbar, which probably seemed less disgusting than forcing some poor grunt to dig through Puckwood's pockets. They dumped everything into boxes and carried the boxes to the back of the truck.</p>

<p>The driver's door of the limousine opened. An officer stepped out and stood up and peered into the trees in my direction.</p>

<p>&quot;Klust?&quot; he called. &quot;Are you out there, Klust?&quot;</p>

<p>I stepped forward out of the shadows, my hands raised. The soldiers aimed their rifles at me<span class="mdash"></span>and frankly I wouldn't have been surprised if one or more of them had gotten jumpy and opened fired<span class="mdash"></span>but I lived.</p>

<p>&quot;Halt!&quot; they all shouted at once. &quot;Don't move! Don't move!&quot;</p>

<p>I didn't move. I kept my hands raised high in the air.</p>

<p>One of the soldiers ran towards me. He fumbled with the lapels of my jacket.</p>

<p>&quot;Inside jacket pocket,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Shut the fuck up!&quot; he screamed. His breath, as expected, smelled worse than a fresh dog turd. He reached inside my jacket, pulled out the badge, and shone the light of his torch upon it. Then he tilted his head back up towards mine.</p>

<p>&quot;Password!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pink tulips,&quot; I told him.</p>

<p>A gruff voice emerged the limo, almost too soft to be discerned above the racket of the soldiers, although somehow completely certain of itself that it would be heard.</p>

<p>&quot;Let him pass,&quot; said the general.</p>

<p>&quot;Sir, I apologize, sir,&quot; said the soldier to me, handing the badge back.</p>

<p>&quot;That's fine,&quot; I told him.</p>

<p>&quot;Klust,&quot; said the general. &quot;Come here.&quot;</p>

<p>The driver stepped around the front of the car to the back door and opened it and stepped aside. The interior was even darker and gloomier than the street outside. I patted down my pants and jacket to try and smack the mud, which had mostly dried, off my suit. It was mostly hopeless endeavor.</p>

<p>&quot;Leave it be,&quot; said the general from within. &quot;You can take your suit to the cleaners tomorrow. Get in.&quot;</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>The cloud of cigarette smoke inside the limousine was so thick that it felt as if an old rag had been stuffed up my nostrils and I had to breathe through it, sucking in whatever bits of actual air that still existed. The staff officer seated directly across from the general was no more than a ghostly brown outline beyond the fog. The only illumination came from the electric lights on the dashboard up at the very front of the vehicle and the glowing orange tips of everyone's cigarettes.</p>

<p>&quot;Have a smoke,&quot; the general urged. &quot;Have a smoke and a drink. You've earned it. Plus it helps to take the edge off.&quot;</p>

<p>I slipped out a half-sogged cigarette and stuck it through the mouth hole of my sack into the hole where my lips had once been. The staff officer leaned forward, snapped open his lighter, and put the flame to my cigarette. Then he poured me a drink from a bottle I could hardly seen in the gloom. He handed me the glass. I sipped it. It was whiskey.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; said the general, &quot;about<span class="mdash"></span>that young man<span class="mdash"></span>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Puckwood, sir,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Putzwoof,&quot; the general continued. &quot;He was a good soldier, loyal and courageous. Could give quite the wallop when he needed to, from what I hear, too. It's a damn shame. It didn't have to be this way. Some people just insist on fighting, even when theirs is a lost cause. I mean the people out there, not Putzwoof. The police, the followers of this young lady, this Maxine<span class="mdash"></span>Maud<span class="mdash"></span>Madeleine, all of them. They'll lose in the end, of course, but they can be a pain in the ass until then.&quot;</p>

<p>The general paused as if he expected me to make some remark, but I had nothing to say.</p>

<p>&quot;You did good work today, Klust. Excellent work. It did not go unnoticed.&quot;</p>

<p>The general raised a glass towards the mouth hole of his sack and swallowed the contents in one go.</p>

<span class="divider"></span>

<p>&quot;Tell me, Klust,&quot; the general said. &quot;What is your motivation? Why do you keep doing what you do? Is it that you want to live? To a ripe old age perhaps? Do you want to save the lives your family and those you love? Do you want to save the world? Save humanity? Save civilization? Hm?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just to keep going, I suppose,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Just to keep going?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose so. The world is stuck in a bit of a ditch at the moment. Seems we each just need to find a way to dig our own way out of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see. That's an interesting analogy. Taking it a bit further&quot;<span class="mdash"></span>the general paused to take a big suck off his cigarette<span class="mdash"></span>&quot;it is difficult to look towards the horizon when you can't see above the rim of the ditch you are stuck in at the moment.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Something like that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see. That's fine. It's nothing to be ashamed of. You are honest. I respect that. I suppose at the very least you must want to live, is that right, at least?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir, it is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought so. We all want to live, even if our faces have rotted off. But in this day and age, sad to say, you cannot even assume that<span class="mdash"></span>the will to live.&quot;</p>

<p>The general lit another cigarette off the butt of the last. He took a long, slow drag and held the smoke in for some time and finally released it in a cloud that exited from the eye holes and the mouth hole of his mask as if his entire head was on fire. He sat in silence while the ash at the tip of his cigarette grew longer and longer.</p>

<p>&quot;We need good men,&quot; he said at last. &quot;Good men to survive this catastrophe and rebuild a new world. Good men, honest men, strong men. Men who can look the world in the eye and see it for what it is. Those men who can comprehend the problem will be the ones who can solve it. I see that in you, Klust. You are that type of man.&quot;</p>

<p>He paused. I realized I was supposed to say something. &quot;Thank you, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>He continued: &quot;Before we can rebuild<span class="mdash"></span>and we will rebuild<span class="mdash"></span>we need to clear a path. We need to remove the deadwood, dig the foundations, prepare to move forward and forge ahead the moment a cure is found. We must remove all impediments, all obstacles. Do you understand what I am trying to explain to you, Klust?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Somewhat, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>The general flicked a finger to signal the officer who sat facing us. The officer handed a folder to the general. The general opened the folder and set it open flat on the seat between us. A photograph of my boss was paperclipped to the front. It was my boss's personnel file.</p>

<p>&quot;Remove the obstacles,&quot; said the general. &quot;The world which we will rebuild belongs to the strong, the resolute, the bold. Do you understand now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir, I think I do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good. Is this something you can handle? Can we entrust you with removing this obstruction?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good. By midnight, latest. Midnight, but the sooner the better.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Puckwood is down,&quot; I said. &quot;Do you have any soldiers to spare?&quot;</p>

<p>The general cackled, almost choking on his cigarette, so that for a few seconds I thought he was having a heart attack. After coughing and downing another shot of whiskey to restore his equilibrium he said, &quot;Even if I did, this is something you must do alone. You are one of the elite, one of the boldest and bravest. You are one of the chosen ones destined to lead us into a brave new world. Go out and prove it. Do not let us down. Go out and show the world the actions of a true leader.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir. I understand, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good.&quot; The general glanced to the front of the limousine. &quot;Where are we?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Close, sir,&quot; said the driver. &quot;Half a dozen blocks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's more than close enough. Pull over.&quot;</p>

<p>The vehicle eased to a stop.</p>

<p>&quot;Out you go, Klust,&quot; said the general. &quot;Tomorrow heralds a bright new day for us all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>I didn't quite know what I was thanking him for<span class="mdash"></span>perhaps for not having had me killed<span class="mdash"></span>but it seemed an appropriate thing to say, or at least something that would do. Before I could even pull the lever to open the door for myself, the door had been opened by a soldier who had run out from the truck behind the limousine. I stepped out. The limousine and the truck started back off, turned a corner at the end of block, and were gone.</p>

<p>It was a clear night, cool but not cold. With all the street lights that were out, the stars of the night sky were actually visible again.</p>
