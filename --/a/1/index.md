For fourteen thousand years their embryos had been stored in a vault five miles beneath the surface of the earth. When the need arose for intelligent organisms, suitable embryos were transferred to artificial wombs and allowed to gestate for between two hundred seventy and two hundred ninety days, as conditions warranted. They were removed from the wombs, exposed to artificial light, cared for by a small team of adult humans, and educated by an artificial intelligence system named Mother. The vault spanned no more than five hundred square meters, including the cooling, food production, and water and waste recycling systems; the half dozen adults and dozen children who could survive within its confines were all the people they would ever know in their lives; and they were the lucky ones, the ones destined to climb up and see the sky. They would perish, of course, but due to the constraints of the vault, senescence was a luxury afforded to no one anyway.
